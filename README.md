# Internship
Implementation of TF-IDF, word2vec, and RNN for API data in SMX Summer 2023 internship.

The TestJSON folder consists of 3 JSON files pulled from the Army API folder. This is used better to visualize the TF-IDF matrix before the API data.
By default, tfidf.py will use the actual ArmyAPI data.
