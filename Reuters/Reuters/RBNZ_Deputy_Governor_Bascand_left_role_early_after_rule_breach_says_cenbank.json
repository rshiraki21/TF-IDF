The RBNZ Board and the Minister of Finance have been informed, the bank said.The news about his early departure was first reported by the National Business Review.The RBNZ last month appointed three new assistant governors in a bid to strengthen its leadership team after several senior officials, including Bascand and Chief Economist Yuong Ha, decided to leave.Governor Adrian Orr told a parliamentary panel in December that the staff turnover resulted from operational changes and individual choices rather than issues with his leadership."}
