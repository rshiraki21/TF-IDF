The abuses were allegedly committed by security contractors and security employees of Petra's subsidiary Williamson Diamonds Limited (WDL).\"Petra Diamonds Limited today confirms that a settlement has been reached, on a no admission of liability basis,\" Petra said in a statement.A London-based law firm, Leigh Day, had sued Petra in a London court on behalf of 71 claimants who alleged the human rights abuses.Petra owns 75% of the mine, while the Tanzania government owns the rest.
