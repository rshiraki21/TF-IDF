{"text": "CHICAGO, April 12 Chicago Mercantile exchange lean hog futures dropped sharply on Monday, with numerous contracts closing down the daily 3 cent limit on a round of profit-taking after the front month contract hit its highest since June 2014 last week.We have had a strong run and we are coming up a little bit short on fresh bullish inputs, said Matthew Wiegand, a risk management consultant and commodity broker at FuturesOne in Nebraska. That creates a bit of an opportunity for profit taking in the absence of something to take us higher.CME June lean hogs dropped 3 cents to 105.95 cents per pound. The May and July contracts also posted limit down moves but losses in the front-month April contract were kept in check from tight supplies in the cash market.The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the pork carcass cutout value on Monday afternoon at $110.10, down $3.07 from the nearly 11-month high it hit on Friday.Cattle contracts also ended in negative territory.CME June live cattle settled 0.475 cent lower at 122.1 cents per pound.Live cattle was pressured by follow-through selling as the market extended its retreat from a 15-month high the front-month contract hit on Thursday.Feeder cattle also eased, with the May futures contract shedding 0.025 cents to 149.6 cents per pound.
