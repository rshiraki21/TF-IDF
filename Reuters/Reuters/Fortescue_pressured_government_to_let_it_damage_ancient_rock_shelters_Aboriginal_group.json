{"text": "The Wintawari Guruma, on whose ancestral lands Fortescue operates, said that the miner had threatened legal action against a government panel tasked with protecting Aboriginal heritage, rather than talk to them about site preservation, in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry.Fortescue said in a statement that its primary objective was to avoid heritage sites, and that had saved nearly 6,000 sites.Fortescue Chief Executive Officer Elizabeth Gaines said that the miner had committed to protect and avoid the two rock shelters and that it disagreed with Wintawaris characterisation of its behaviour and approach to Aboriginal heritage.The destruction in May, which caused deep distress to the traditional owners, has shone a light on the lack of legal protection for Aboriginal sites, ultimately cost Rios chief executive his job and forced miners to review their practices.Fortescue lawyers Green Legal had written to the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee in April as part of an application to get approvals for Fortescues Solomon hub expansion.The letter, dated April 22, said that if the committee did not make a recommendation to the government about its application by May 19 then it would compel the ACMC to do so including taking legal action against it.The Wintawari Guruma said in a separate submission that it considered Fortescues historical approach to gaining approvals to be bullying, dismissive, disrespectful, and inconsistent with their published values and the expected behaviours of an ASX Top Ten Company.The Wintawari told the inquiry last month that Fortescue had withheld royalty payments amounting to A$1.9 million ($1.38 million) because it had declined to sign mining approvals without more information about the miners plans.($1 = 1.3789 Australian dollars)"}
