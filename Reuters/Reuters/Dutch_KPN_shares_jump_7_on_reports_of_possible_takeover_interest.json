{"text": "AMSTERDAM, Oct 12 KPN shares jumped more than 7% on Monday, buoyed by possible takeover interest in the main Dutch telecom provider.Bloomberg on Friday reported that European private equity firm EQT was considering a potential bid for KPN.The buyout firm was said to be in early discussions with possible advisers on the feasibility of a deal, without any final decision having been made.KPN and EQT declined to comment on the report.Shares in KPN traded up 7.5% at 0805 GMT in Amsterdam, reaching their highest level in three months. KPN shares had lost 15% since the start of the year until Friday.KBC Securities analysts on Monday said a deal could make sense considering EQTs ownership of fiberglass supplier Delta Fiber, which has the second-largest fiber footprint in the Netherlands after KPN.A deal could be opposed by the company and Dutch government.A new law adopted this year gives the government the option to block takeovers of Dutch telecom companies if they are deemed a threat to national security.KPN also has a strong defence against unwanted takeovers, in the form of a foundation that can build up a controlling stake to block any deal.This proved successful in 2013, when KPN won a lengthy battle against unsolicited interest from Mexicos America Movil .
