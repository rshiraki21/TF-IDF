{"text": "LONDON A man who made music videos about his admiration for Islamic State was convicted on Friday for planning a terrorist attack in Britain, Londons Metropolitan Police said.Sahayb Abu, 27, ordered weapons, equipment and clothing online in preparation for an attack, the police said, and was detained in an armed police operation after ordering a large sword online.Over several months, Abu sought to obtain weapons and the equipment needed to commit a terrorist attack, said Richard Smith, head of the Mets Counter Terrorism Command.He is an extremely dangerous individual, but we were able to intervene and arrest him before he was able to carry out his attack.Police seized electronic devices from Abu when he was arrested on July 9, and found video and voice messages where Abu recited lyrics describing himself as a straight ISIS supporter and referring to having a suicide vest.Abu had denied planning a terrorist attack and said equipment he had purchased was for parody drill music videos, a form of rap that focuses on violence and crime.He is due to be sentenced on April 9."}
