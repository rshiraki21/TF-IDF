{"text": "    PRAGUE, Aug 12 The zloty fell further on\nThursday after Polish lawmakers passed a media reform bill that\ndrew criticism from the United States, while other central\nEuropean currencies strengthened on rate hike hopes.\n    The Hungarian forint edged higher toward a one-month peak\nhit earlier this week while the Czech crown held steady,\nhovering off its own 2-week high touched on Tuesday.\n    Both have led gains in central Europe this year - while the\nzloty has lost value - as the Czech and Hungarian central banks\njumped ahead of other European Union monetary policymakers and\nbegan raising interest rates in June to battle inflationary\npressures seen amid a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\n    Poland, meanwhile, has held steady on its monetary policy\nand remained cautious of hurting the recovery, and political\npressures are also weighing more, seen on Thursday when the\nzloty fell 0.3% to 4.59 to the euro in morning trade.\n    A Polish government bill, strengthening a ban on firms from\noutside the European Economic Area controlling Polish\nbroadcasters, made it through Poland's lower house of parliament\nlate on Wednesday and will now head to the Senate.\n    The Polish opposition said the bill was meant to silence a\nU.S.-owned news channel critical of the government, leading to a\nswift denunciation from the United States, one of Warsaw's most\nimportant allies.  \n    Commerzbank said due to political risks it \"consider(ed) an\nincreased PLN risk premium to be justified for the time being.\"\n    Elsewhere, the forint was up 0.2% at 353.1 to the\neuro at 0904 GMT, finding continued support from expectations\nthe Hungarian central bank could deliver a third interest rate\nincrease when it meets again in August.\n    Minutes from its July meeting release on Wednesday showed\nits last 30-basis-point rate increase could serve as guidance\nfor the size of its next move.\n    The crown, too, was steady, trading at 25.40 to the euro,\nbuoyed by a larger-than-expected inflation s pike that has\nraised chances the Czech central bank may opt for a\nbigger-than-usual rate increases after two consecutive\n25-basis-point hikes.\n    On stock markets, Warsaw and Budapest eased\nbut Prague jumped 1.4%, with Stock Spirits, listed in\nLondon and Prague, soaring over 40% after CVC-affiliated funds\nsaid they would buy the drinks group for about $1 billion.\n\n    \n    \n                   CEE      SNAPSHO   AT                      \n                   MARKETS  T        1105
