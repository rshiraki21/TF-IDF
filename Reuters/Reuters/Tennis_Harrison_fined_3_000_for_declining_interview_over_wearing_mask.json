But Im an absolute safety hazard walking maskless through a restaurant.Christian Harrison was fined $3,000 for declining the mandatory post-match on-court interview following his second round win over Cristian Garin on Saturday, the ATP said in a statement.Harrison reached his maiden ATP semi-final by defeating Gianluca Mager 7-6(2) 6-4 at the event on Monday.He wore a mask for the subsequent on-court interview and later said in an Instagram post he was not aware it was mandatory to wear one for TV interviews.He added that the ATP supervisor had told him that the fine would be rescinded if he appealed and promised to follow tournament rules even if he did not agree with them.Its not healthy to wear a mask in the hot sun for more time than absolutely necessary after a tough match. I was given the impression it was optional. I wasnt told I would be fined, he said in the post.I was required to do a sit-down interview after the match with the same person which I agreed to and I did not have to wear a mask for it. Its not about safety to wear mask for TV to talk to a microphone with no one around.I dont support masking people for the sake of it for TV."}
