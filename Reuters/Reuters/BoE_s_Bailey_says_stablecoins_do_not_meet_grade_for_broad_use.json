{"text": "LONDON, Nov 12 Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he did not think that privately operated digital currencies known as stablecoins were suitable for widespread use or could be trusted as a safe store of value like many traditional currencies.The bar is set very high for private stablecoins, and I dont think they have met that bar, Bailey told a European Central Bank panel discussion, echoing previous scepticism about projects such as Facebooks Libra.It may be that the answer ... is actually a central bank digital currency, where you would get that guarantee and certainty of value, he added.
