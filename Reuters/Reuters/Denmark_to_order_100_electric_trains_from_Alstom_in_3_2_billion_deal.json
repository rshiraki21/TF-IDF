{"text": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Denmarks state-owned railway operator DSB said on Monday it will buy 100 new electric trains from Frances Alstom in a deal worth 20 billion Danish crowns ($3.2 billion).The new trains are built around Alstoms Coradia Stream platform already in use in Italy and will replace Denmarks diesel-powered trains.With the order of new electric trains we can look forward to retiring the aging diesel trains in a few years, the chairman of DSB, Peter Schtze, said in a statement.The new trains, which will each comprise five carriages, are scheduled to enter service in late-2024 with the last deliveries due in 2030, DSB said, adding the deal included service and maintenance.The purchase comes after a botched purchase of Italian trains more than a decade ago. Technical problems with the 85 trains, of which less than half are currently still in use, ended up costing the Danish state hundreds of millions of dollars, causing a public outcry.The railway operator said it expects to purchase another 50 trains at a later stage.($1 = 6.2442 Danish crowns)"}
