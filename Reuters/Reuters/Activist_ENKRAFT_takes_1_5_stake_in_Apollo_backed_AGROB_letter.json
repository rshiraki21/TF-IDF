{"text": "ENKRAFT reckons that based on achievable commercial rents and public real estate valuations, a valuation of more than 400 million euro for AGROBs portfolio is more realistic.The supervisory board should encourage management to present and implement a convincing strategy to continually raise the value of AGROB, ENKRAFTs Benedikt Kormaier wrote.Such a strategy is not visible, neither with regard to the development of real estate assets nor with regard to the capital structure of AGROB.ENKRAFT also said the company had so far failed to outline plans for unused land lots it owns.Munich regularly leads national rankings in terms of Germanys real estate prices.AGROB Immobilien had no immediate comment."}
