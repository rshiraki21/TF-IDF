The loss of aluminium scrap, meanwhile, is manifest in the dramatic turnaround in alloy trade flows.Flows of metal concentrates from producer nations such a Peru have also been disrupted by lockdown.Copper concentrate imports were flat year-on-year in the first seven months of 2020, a constrained outcome given Chinas continuing build-out of smelter capacity and the consequent need for higher raw materials imports.Lead concentrate imports fell by 25% in the first half of this year, compounding the scrap impact on a market that is heavily dependent on recyclable material.Refined lead imports were subdued in the first part of 2020 but jumped to almost 10,000 tonnes in July, the highest monthly total since March 2019.Zinc concentrate imports remained strong over most of the first half, up 42% on last year in bulk tonnage terms, but Junes imports slumped to a one-year low in June as shipments from locked-down Peru all but evaporated.Refined metal imports were also running at a subdued level until June, when inflow jumped to a 10-month high of 65,000 tonnes.Tin provides the clearest example of raw materials constraints feeding into the refined metal market.Flows of tin concentrate, largely from mines in Myanmar, fell another 8% in January-June, extending a long-running downtrend. The combination with closures of some of Chinas own mines has seen the country lift imports of refined tin to 9,400 tonnes from just 1,000 tonnes in the first half of 2019.Indeed, China has flipped back from net exporter in 2018 and 2019 to net importer of the soldering metal.EXUBERANCEBroken or damaged supply chains are the main differentiator, and an unambiguously bullish one, between this and the last crisis.However, other drivers behind Chinas import surge look remarkably similar.Now, as then, Chinas giant manufacturing sector has led the global recovery thanks to Beijings infrastructure-heavy stimulus.That in turn has fed bullish exuberance on Chinese metal markets even while the rest of the world has gone into COVID-19 meltdown. The resulting outperformance of Shanghai contracts such as aluminium has forced open an arbitrage window, through which increasing tonnages are now heading to China.Now, as then, local Chinese prices have been artificially lifted by state purchases of unsold metal and stockpiling by regional governments lending a helping balance-sheet hand to local producers.Now, as then, there is a strong sense of a speculative stock surge overlaying the industrial restocking exercise currently underway.And just to heighten the sense of collective deja-vu, there is much speculation that the Chinese state is itself stockpiling copper.The State Reserves Bureau is a secretive organisation so the speculation remains just that but every copper trader knows that the Bureaus strategic purchases were a big part of the copper price rally from the 2009 lows below $3,000 per tonne to the all-time high of $10,190 in the second quarter of 2011.Theres certainly no denying that the scale of Chinas copper imports so far this year exceeds any analysts estimate of a normal industrial restocking cycle.SOAKING UP SURPLUSThe real impact of Chinas renewed hunger for refined metal, however, is playing out in the international market.LME copper stocks are currently low at 114,575 tonnes with more than half of that earmarked for physical load-out.Such depleted inventory seems anomalous given the massive hit to demand that has occurred this year until you consider that China imported 440,000 tonnes more copper on a net basis in the first half of this year than last year.Thats 440,000 tonnes that in all likelihood wont be coming back again and Julys record tally will have lifted that figure significantly higher.Similarly with aluminium. State research house Antaike is expecting primary imports of 400,000 tonnes this year, not enough to wipe out the expected surplus outside of China, but certainly sufficient to dent it.How long these supercharged Chinese imports can continue remains to be seen.But for now, it looks like China is coming to the rescue of industrial metal markets.Again."}
