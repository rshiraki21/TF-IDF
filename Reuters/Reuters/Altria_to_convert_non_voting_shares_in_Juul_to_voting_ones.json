{"text": "Altria Group Inc said on Thursday it would convert its non-voting shares in Juul Labs Inc to voting shares, days after the tobacco giant took another billion-dollar hit to its 35% stake in the e-cigarette maker.The company said it does not intend to exercise its additional governance rights obtained upon conversion, including the right to elect directors to Juuls board, pending the outcome of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) litigation.Altria also does not intend to vote its Juul shares other than as a passive investor during the lawsuit.The FTC in April filed a complaint aimed at forcing Altria to sell its investment in Juul, citing competition concerns.The Marlboro cigarette maker invested $12.8 billion in late-2018 for a minority stake in Juul through non-voting shares, with their conversion to voting shares linked to antitrust clearance.Altria last month took a $2.6 billion hit to the investment, reducing the value of the stake to $1.6 billion.Shares of Altria, down 20% this year, were marginally lower in premarket trading on Thursday."}
