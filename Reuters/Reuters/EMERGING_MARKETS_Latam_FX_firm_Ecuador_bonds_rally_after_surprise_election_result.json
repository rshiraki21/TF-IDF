So I do think that after the initial honeymoon stage,\ninvestors will start to think, how does the country move\nforward?\"\n    \n    PERUVIAN JOLT \n    In Peru, MSCI's Peru ETF was down almost 3% at\n$35.16 in U.S. trading after the country's presidential vote\nheaded for a run-off with far-left candidate Pedro Castillo set\nto win the Andean country's first round.  \n    The Peruvian stock index fell 0.2%, while the\nsol currency lost 2.07% at open to 3.68/3.70 per\ndollar.\n    \"Castillo's three pillars are pretty scary. He's talking\nabout nationalisation, about the government taking control of\nthe economy. He's in favour of governments or revolutions like\nin Cuba, Ecuador, Venezuela, so it's something that could bring\nsignificant volatility to the market, just to the bonds\noverall,\" Jupiter Asset Management's Arevalo said. \n    \"We have to wait for the final votes to be counted, but it's\ndefinitely something negative for the market.\"\n    As the dollar weakened ahead of much awaited U.S. consumer\nprice inflation data, other Latam currencies firmed along with\nthe broader emerging market peers, with Mexico's peso\nhovering near their highest since mid-February.\n    Brazil's real rose 0.4%, while higher oil prices\nhelped crude exporter Colombia's peso mark a positive\nstart to the week. \n    Climbing oil prices also propped up shares of Brazilian\nstate oil giant Petrobras, helping the country's main\nstocks index outperform a rout in global stocks ahead of\nU.S. inflation data and earnings. \n    \n    Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1429 GMT:\n  Stock indexes           Latest   Daily %\n                                   change\n MSCI Emerging Markets    1321.51    -0.67\n                                   \n MSCI LatAm               2343.10     0.26\n                                   \n Brazil Bovespa         118363.16     0.59\n                                   \n Mexico IPC              47460.83    -0.35\n                                   \n Chile IPSA               4926.46    -0.64\n                                   \n Argentina MerVal        48541.53   -0.623\n                                   \n Colombia COLCAP          1323.98     0.14\n                                   \n                                          \n      Currencies          Latest   Daily %\n                                   change\n Brazil real               5.6480     0.44\n                                   \n Mexico peso              20.0940     0.26\n                                   \n Chile peso                 706.8     0.68\n                                   \n Colombia peso            3648.03     0.27\n                                   \n Peru sol                   3.685    -1.76\n                                   \n Argentina peso           92.5800    -0.15\n (interbank)                       \n                                   \n \n (Reporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru and Tom Arnold in\nLondon;\nEditing by Gareth Jones)\n  "}
