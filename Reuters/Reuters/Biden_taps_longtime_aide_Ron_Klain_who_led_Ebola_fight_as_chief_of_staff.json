He was in charge of the Barack Obama administrations response to the Ebola health crisis in 2014, when Biden was vice president.A fierce critic of Republican President Donald Trumps handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Klain was expected to be a key figure in Bidens response to the health crisis.Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014, Biden said in a statement.Klain said in a statement: Its the honor of a lifetime to serve President-elect Biden in this role, and I am humbled by his confidence. I look forward to helping him and the Vice President-elect assemble a talented and diverse team to work in the White House.Klain was Bidens vice-presidential chief of staff and was most recently a senior advisor to Bidens presidential campaign."}
