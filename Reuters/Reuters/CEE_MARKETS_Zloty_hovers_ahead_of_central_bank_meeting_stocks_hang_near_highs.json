{"text": "    PRAGUE, Jan 12 Hungary's forint led gains among\ncentral European currencies on Tuesday, looking to end a retreat\nover the past week, while the zloty slipped before a Polish\ncentral bank meeting this week, drawing more attention than\nusual.\n    Stock markets also largely gained and were near their\nhighest levels since February.\n    The forint had risen 0.2% to 360.66 to the euro by\n1125 GMT and the zloty fell 0.1% to 4.528.\n    The zloty is forecast to gain the most in the region in 2021\nalthough central bank comments on possible rate cuts or foreign\nexchange market intervention to weaken the currency are leaving\nmany cautious in the short-term.\n    The central bank (NBP) will decide on policy on Wednesday\nand rates are expected to stay on hold. Governor Adam Glapinski\nhas said that a rate cut could be possible in the first quarter\nand that the bank started market interventions in mid-December.\n    \"The increase in appetite for emerging market assets is\nneutralized by concerns about NBP currency interventions,\" Bank\nMillennium said.\n    Elsewhere, the Czech crown added 0.2% to 26.215\nper euro and was off recent highs. Romania's leu was\nsteady.\n    Czech bond yields ticked higher before a scheduled auction\non Wednesday.\n    Prague and Warsaw stocks gained but hung off\nof highs last seen in February which they hit on Monday.\nBudapest was off a similar peak.\n    \"I do not think the Hungarian stock market can stay this\nhigh or continue to climb further. It rose way too much in the\npast two months and there needs to be a correction in the long\nterm,\" a stock trader in Budapest said. \n                   CEE      SNAPSHO   AT                      \n
