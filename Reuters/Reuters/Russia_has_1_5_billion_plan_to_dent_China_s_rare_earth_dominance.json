{"text": "* Russia to raise share in global rare earths output to 10%* Aims to become almost self-sufficient in them by 2025* Plans to start exports from 2026MOSCOW, Aug 12 Russia plans investment of $1.5 billion in rare earth minerals, critical to the defence, telecommunications and renewable energy sectors, as it strives to become the biggest producer after China by 2030, a top government official told Reuters.Russia's initiative is in line with other countries, such as the United States, which are also trying to curb their reliance on China, home to 63% of global rare earths production and 37% of global reserves here.Chinas dominance is so established, it is hard to weaken.Russia has reserves of 12 million tonnes, or 10% of the global total, and its government is willing to back any foreign investment.Alexei Besprozvannykh, Russias deputy industry and trade minister, said Russia is offering reduced mining taxes and cheaper loans to investors in a list of 11 projects designed to increase Russias share of global rare earths output to 10% by 2030 from 1.3% now.The Russian projects will require at least $1.5 billion in investment, he said.China will keep its market dominance, but Russias goal is to be at least the second after them by 2030, Besprozvannykh told Reuters in an interview.So far rare earth processing is almost totally controlled by China, with the exception a plant in Malaysia, operated by Australias Lynas Corp, and the U.S. is reviving production.The 11 projects, which include developing the Tomtor deposit in Russias far east, will allow Russia to become almost self-sufficient in rare earth elements by 2025 and start exports in 2026, the deputy minister said.By 2024, Russias production of rare earths concentrate may reach 7,000 tonnes a year, he added. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated Russias 2019 production at 2,700 tonnes.
