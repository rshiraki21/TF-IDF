Its infections are at their peak, averaging more than 9,000 a day, with 846,765 total cases.Budi said two-thirds of the 270 million population must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.Olivia Herlinda, a researcher at the Center for Indonesias Strategic Development Initiatives, said the government had not taken into account the vaccine efficacy and virus reproduction rate to justify its herd immunity focus.Epidemiologist Masdalina Pane said that vaccines had to be accompanied by increased testing and tracing.Theres not one bullet, she said.Budi said Indonesias testing and tracing needed improving, adding there was an imbalance in testing resources across the archipelago.Indonesia will get another 122.5 million doses of CoronaVac by January 2022, with about 30 million doses by the end of the first quarter this year, according to Budis presentation.It has secured nearly 330 million doses of vaccines, including from AstraZeneca and Pfizer and its partner BioNTech."}
