{"text": "PRAGUE, Jan 12 The Czech National Bank will need to deliver one or two stronger hikes yet, and then fine-tune its main interest rate from the policy meeting in May as inflation should peak in the first quarter, Vice-Governor Marek Mora said on Wednesday.The central bank raised its key two-week repo rate by 1 percentage point to 3.75% at its last policy meeting in December, bringing the total rise of the rate to 350 basis points in the current tightening phase it started in June.One, two steps will yet have to be more pronounced. I would assume that it will be more than 25 basis points in February, Mora said in an interview for seznamzpravy.cz news website.From May, it will be a fine-tuning process. I dont think that the (current) pace will continue, we are close to the summit of our rates, he said.However, the main rate will have to go above 4%, Mora said.There is no ceiling for us. Sky is the limit, as the English say, he said.At the last policy meeting, a majority of the board saw significant risk of inflation expectations decoupling from the central banks target, set at 2% with a tolerance band of 1 percentage point in both directions.In November, the annual inflation was 6% year-on-year, the fastest pace since 2008.The inflation (peak) does not have be even 9%, but we could get to a double-digit level, around 10%. That cannot be ruled out. We will experience elevated inflation in January, February, March, Mora said.It should slow down in April, May, June. A significant slowdown should come in the second half of the year, but the worst is still ahead of us.Inflation data for December is due at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT)."}
