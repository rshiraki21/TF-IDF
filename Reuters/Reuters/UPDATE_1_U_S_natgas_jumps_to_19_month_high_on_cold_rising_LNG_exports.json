{"text": " (Adds latest prices)\n    Oct 12 U.S. natural gas futures spiked on Monday to their highest since March 2019 as\nthe amount of gas flowing to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants jumps with units returning in\nLouisiana after Hurricane Delta and in Maryland after maintenance work.\n    Traders also noted prices were up on forecasts for colder weather and higher heating demand over\nthe next two weeks and with output on track to drop to its lowest since July 2018 due mostly to well\nshut-ins for Delta.\n    Delta slammed into the Louisiana coast late Friday, causing over 878,000 customers to lose power.\nThere were about 224,000 homes and businesses still without service Monday morning, mostly in\nLouisiana.\n    Front-month gas futures rose 14.0 cents, or 5.1%, to settle at $2.881 per million British\nthermal units, their highest close since March 2019.\n    Data provider Refinitiv said output in the Lower 48 U.S. states would slide from a 26-month low of\n82.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) over the weekend to a preliminary 82.0 bcfd on Monday due to the\nDelta shut-ins.\n    The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said energy firms started to return\noffshore production in the Gulf of Mexico. BSEE said that output was now curtailed by 1.3 bcfd, down\nfrom 1.7 bcfd on Sunday.\n    In Louisiana, the Cameron and Sabine Pass LNG export plants both took in more pipeline gas over the\nweekend and tankers started to return to Sabine. There is also at least one vessel waiting in the Gulf\nof Mexico to go to Cameron, according to Refinitiv data.\n    In Maryland, Dominion's Cove Point started to exit its three-week annual maintenance outage.\n\n    As LNG feedgas rises and the weather turns colder, Refinitiv projected average demand would jump\nfrom 84.6 bcfd this week to 94.8 bcfd next week. That is higher than Refinitiv's forecast on Friday.   \n                \n                                       Week ended     Week ended    Year ago   Five-year   \n                                         Oct 9         Oct 2         Oct 9      average    \n                                       (Forecast)      (Actual)                  Oct 9     \n U.S. natgas storage (bcf):                +63           +75          +102        +87 Refinitiv Heating (HDD), Cooling (CDD) and Total (TDD) Degree Days                        \n Two-Week Total Forecast               Current Day    Prior Day    Prior Year   10-Year    30-Year Norm\n                                                                                  Norm     \n U.S. GFS HDDs                             161           119          190         125          143\n U.S. GFS CDDs                             41             57           37          45           34\n U.S. GFS TDDs                             202           176          227         160          177\n                                                                                           \n Refinitiv U.S. Weekly GFS Supply and Demand Forecasts                                     \n                                       Prior Week    Current Week  Next Week   This Week    Five-Year\n                                                                               Last Year   Average For\n                                                                                              Month\n U.S. Supply (bcfd)\n U.S. Lower 48 Dry Production             86.8           83.0         83.5        94.9         80.1\n U.S. Imports from Canada                  6.7           6.3          6.3         7.3          7.6\n U.S. LNG Imports                          0.0           0.0          0.0         0.0          0.2\n Total U.S. Supply                        92.5           89.3         89.8       102.2         87.9\n \n U.S. Demand (bcfd)\n U.S. Exports to Canada                    2.2           2.3          2.3         2.1          1.9\n U.S. Exports to Mexico                    5.9           6.0          6.0         5.6          4.5\n U.S. LNG Exports                          7.1           6.5          8.2         6.6          2.3\n U.S. Commercial                           6.0           5.7          8.5         7.2          6.7\n U.S. Residential                          6.2           5.4          10.9        8.6          7.0\n U.S. Power Plant                         31.2           30.7         29.3        28.9         26.8\n U.S. Industrial                          22.2           21.9         23.3        22.2         21.0\n U.S. Plant Fuel                           4.2           4.1          4.1         4.1          4.3\n U.S. Pipe Distribution                    1.9           1.9          2.1         1.9          1.8\n U.S. Vehicle Fuel                         0.1           0.1          0.1         0.1          0.1\n Total U.S. Consumption                   71.8           69.8         78.4        73.0         67.7\n Total U.S. Demand                        87.0           84.6         94.8        87.3         76.4 SNL U.S. Natural Gas Next-Day Prices ($ per mmBtu)                                        \n Hub                                   Current Day    Prior Day                            \n Henry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL                  2.25           1.49                              \n Transco Z6 New York NG-CG-NY-SNL       0.52           0.67                              \n PG&E Citygate NG-CG-PGE-SNL            3.87           3.86                              \n Dominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL          0.57           0.64                              \n Chicago Citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL          1.23           1.19                              \n Algonquin Citygate NG-CG-BS-SNL        0.74           0.78                              \n SoCal Citygate NG-SCL-CGT-SNL          1.90           2.38                              \n Waha Hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL                0.66           0.89 SNL U.S. Power Next-Day Prices ($ per megawatt-hour)                                      \n Hub                                   Current Day    Prior Day                            \n New England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL             19.50         22.00                              \n PJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL                14.50         18.50                              \n Ercot North EL-PK-ERTN-SNL             45.00         21.50                              \n Mid C EL-PK-MIDC-SNL                   30.00         24.75                              \n Palo Verde EL-PK-PLVD-SNL              36.00         22.00                              \n SP-15 EL-PK-SP15-SNL                   29.75         28.50                              \n \n (Reporting by Scott DiSavino\nEditing by Nick Zieminski and Cynthia Osterman)\n  \n \n "}
