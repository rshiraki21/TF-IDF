Analysts had expected 12.5% growth.Excluding the sharp drop seen during COVID-19 lockdowns early last year, loan growth in April was the slowest since 2002.Broad M2 money supply grew 8.1% from a year earlier, dipping to the lowest since July 2019, and well below estimates of 9.3% forecast in the Reuters poll. It rose 9.4% in March.Investors are increasingly worried about policy tightening as Beijing looks to exit from emergency measures now that the economy is bouncing back from the depths of the pandemic and policymakers turn their focus to containing debt risks.Top leaders last week repeated the pledge that they would not make a sudden turn in macro policy, and will make the economic recovery more balanced.The government has extended a loan repayment relief scheme for small firms to the end of this year.While interest rate hikes are not seen on the cards in China this year due to continued global uncertainties, most analysts expect policy normalisation to continue and previous stimulus policies to be gradually wound down, with credit conditions likely to remain relatively tight throughout the year.Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, slowed to 11.7% in April from a year earlier and from 12.3% in March.Wed been forecasting a deceleration in broad credit growth to 11.5% around this middle of this year. If anything, the latest figures suggest the slowdown is happening even faster, Capital Economics said in a note.And we expect it to continue through the second half, to about 10.5% in December. If that happens, this will be a continued headwind to the economy over the next few quarters.TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.TSF missed expectations in April, when it fell to 1.85 trillion yuan from 3.34 trillion yuan in March. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected April TSF of 2.25 trillion yuan."}
