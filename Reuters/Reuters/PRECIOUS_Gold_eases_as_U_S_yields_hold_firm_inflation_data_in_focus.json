{"text": "    * Markets look to U.S. CPI data on Tuesday\n    * U.S. producer prices hit 9-1/2-year high\n    * U.S. economy at \"inflection point\", says Fed Chair \n\n (Updates prices)\n    By Sumita Layek\n    April 12 Gold prices eased on Monday as U.S.\nTreasury yields remained elevated, denting the appeal of\nbullion, while investors waited for this week's key U.S.\ninflation and retail sales data.\n    Spot gold        was 0.1% down at $1,741.80 an ounce by 1147\nGMT. U.S. gold futures        eased 0.1% to $1,743.50.\n    As long as yields are relatively high, gold will not\nbenefit, said ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele, adding that the\nmarket is now focused on U.S. March Consumer Price Index data\ndue on Tuesday. \n    Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields gained after data on Friday\nshowed U.S. producer prices in March registered their largest\nannual gain in 9-1/2 years, likely marking the start of higher\ninflation as the economy reopens.                        \n    Retail sales data is also due on Thursday.             \n    While gold is considered a shield against inflation, higher\nyields threaten that status because they translate into a higher\nopportunity cost of holding bullion.\n    Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is\nat an \"inflection point\", with hopes that inflation and hiring\nwill accelerate in the coming months. \n    A new Fed framework builds in allowances for inflation to\nrun above the central bank's 2% target for a time without the\nFed intervening.             \n    StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell said gold is likely to\nbenefit if inflation rises much higher than the target. \n    \"(Although) if we do start seeing inflation accelerating and\npeople start thinking interest rates are going to go up again,\nthen gold might struggle a bit.\"\n    Among other precious metals, silver        fell 0.2% to\n$25.20, palladium        was down 0.5% at $2,626.65 and platinum\n       slipped 1.1% to $1,185.56.\n\n (Reporting by Sumita Layek in Bengaluru\nEditing by Kirsten Donovan and David Goodman\n)\n  "}
