{"text": "Earlier this year, Engies board of directors decided not to renew the mandate of CEO Isabelle Kocher, at the time the only female boss of a blue-chip company in France, and to put in place an interim management team after months of boardroom infighting.We want the CEO job to be filled by year-end, which implies choosing the right candidate in September, Engie Chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu told Le Journal du Dimanche.The French state has a 24% stake in Engie, formerly known as GDF Suez.Engie groups together a hotchpotch of businesses with few synergies between them, from a labour-intensive energy services arm to a capital-intensive gas infrastructure unit, and a fast-growing renewables division."}
