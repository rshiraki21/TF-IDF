{"text": "BOGOTA, Aug 12 Colombias government will sign contracts for road projects worth 21.3 trillion pesos ($5.39 billion) before finishing its term next year, Transport Minister Angela Maria Orozco told Reuters.The so-called Fifth Generation concessions package has an estimated cost of 48 trillion pesos and will include 14 projects in its first phase, for which the necessary funds have been secured, while eight potential bidders have expressed interest in the first round of tenders.Weve already awarded the first Fifth Generation project, called the road network of Valle del Cauca, Orozco said during an interview with Reuters late on Wednesday.Four other projects are out for tender, she added, while nine are awaiting approval from the finance ministry and the national planning department.Colombias poor highways and delays to modernize them are considered by analysts as one of the main factors reducing competitiveness in the countrys economy and its international trade.The new packet of investments will add to the 31.5 trillion pesos in highway infrastructure projects established by the government of President Ivan Duque, whose four-year term ends in August 2022, Orozco said.That investment included 20 trillion pesos for the so-called Fourth Generation of projects, which included 29 roadworks, and 11.5 trillion pesos needed for improving tertiary roads.This government established the rhythm of execution of Fourth Generation projects and today we can say that were injecting, more or less, 400 billion pesos a month, she said.The Andean country had hoped to boost its economy by rolling out the Fourth Generation projects, but only six of the projects are advancing adequately, Orozco said.One element contributing to the paralysis of the Fourth Generation projects is the delay in prior consultations, a legal obligation where projects require approval from local communities.Last September, in a bid to tackle the issue, Colombias government issued a presidential order to regulate prior consultations and defined time frames for completing each stage.I have to say that the presidential directive was useful and valuable, and it was very valuable for us to carry out the consultations of our projects, Orozco said.
