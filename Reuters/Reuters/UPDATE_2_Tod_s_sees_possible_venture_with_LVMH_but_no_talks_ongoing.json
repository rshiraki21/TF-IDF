{"text": "(Adds details, CFO quotes)MILAN, May 12 Struggling Italian fashion company Tods could further strengthen its ties with LVMH but there are no ongoing talks and no decision has been made, a top Tods executive said after the French giant increased its stake in the group.Last months announcement that industry leader LVMH would raise its holding in Tods to 10% has fuelled market talk it could help relaunch the Italian brand and eventually take it over.Tods finance chief Emilio Macellari told analysts in a post-results conference call the two groups spoke the same language and could co-operate further, both from an industrial and commercial point of view, citing for example the possibility of sharing space in shopping malls.It is a reasonable possibility that something in the future can be done together, he said. But, seeking to dampen expectations that any announcement may be imminent, he added: There is nothing already decided or discussed with LVMH.Tods Chairman and founder Diego della Valle has been an LVMH board director for the past two decades and is a friend of LVMHs billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, who has built his empire through a string of acquisitions.Tods reported a rebound in first-quarter sales, which grew by 19% from a year earlier when stripping out currency fluctuations and were powered by a 142% jump in China - the first region to be hit by the coronavirus crisis but also the first to re-open shops and relax travel curbs.Overall revenue for the period came in at 178.7 million euros ($215.76 million) slightly above analyst forecasts of 168 million euros, but still below the 216 million euros mark reached in the first quarter of 2019.Revenue fell 15% in the Americas and also posted a double-digit decline in Europe, where new lockdowns were imposed in the first part of this year.Last year, the fallout from the pandemic triggered a revenue fall of almost a third for Tods, one of the worst performances in the sector, marking the fifth year in a row of falling annual sales for the group known for its loafer shoes.However, shares in the group have rallied to rise 57% in just over a month, boosted by news of the LVMH stake acquisition and also by news that Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni would join the board - a move which Macellari said was also meant to help Tods lure younger customers.Macellari said the group was confident it would meet a consensus forecast for 741 million euros in sales this year, which would be 16% higher than last year.Its totally feasible, he said."}
