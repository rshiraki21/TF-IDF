S&P 500 stock futures fell 0.15%.Oil futures rose toward two-month highs due to optimism about a vaccine and a larger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.The gains in Asia came after a mixed performance for U.S. stocks as investors switched back to technology stocks and away from economically sensitive sectors as they weighed COVID-19 vaccine progress and the likely timing of an economic rebound.The markets are waiting for more news about the virus, so it is difficult for investors to short equities, said Daiju Aoki, regional chief investment officer for Japan at UBS Securities.These expectations can keep equities going for another few weeks, but there are still questions about the effectiveness of a vaccine and about U.S. fiscal policy.

U.S. crude futures also gained 0.55% to $41.62 a barrel.Crude markets remain torn by the bleak near-term picture with curfews, closures and shutdowns becoming more widespread across the U.S. and Europe; and the medium-term picture where vaccines may bring a return to more normal conditions, Westpac analysts for Australia and New Zealand wrote in a note Thursday.Spot gold edged up 0.22% to $1,868.76 an ounce.Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell slightly to 0.9406% and the yield curve flattened in Asian trade.
