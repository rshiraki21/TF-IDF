{"text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 12 Returning inflation to the 2% target is the most important task facing the U.S. central bank, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said in remarks prepared for delivery on Thursday to a Senate panel considering her for promotion to the vice chair position.We are seeing the strongest rebound in growth and decline in unemployment of any recovery in the past five decades, Brainard said in the remarks, which were released by the Fed on Wednesday.But inflation is too high, and working people around the country are concerned about how far their paychecks will go. Our monetary policy is focused on getting inflation back down to 2% while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone. This is our most important task, she said.
