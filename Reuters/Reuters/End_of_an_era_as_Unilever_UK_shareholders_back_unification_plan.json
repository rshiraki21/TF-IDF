{"text": "The proposal passed with the support of more than 99% of shares voted.Unilever wants to unify on Nov. 29, ending a hybrid structure that dates back to the merger of British soap maker Lever Brothers and Margarine Unie in the Netherlands.The maker of Dove soap, Hellmanns mayonnaise and Ben & Jerrys ice cream says the dual structure hampers its ability to conduct acquisitions and asset sales quickly, such as the planned sale of its tea business.Such flexibility is key to Unilevers ambition to shift its portfolio into higher-growth areas like premium beauty. Unilever has said this will become even more important as a result of the pandemic.The final steps towards completing the unification include UK High Court hearings on Oct. 23 and Nov. 2, with the Dutch-listed shares ceasing trading after Nov. 27.The only potential worry for Unilever is an exit tax proposed by a Dutch opposition party that could cost the company up to 11 billion euros ($13 billion).A top Dutch legal body said on Friday the current plan appeared at odds with fundamental principles of law. The opposition party has re-submitted its proposal for consideration with amendments, though no debate has been scheduled on it in parliament.Unilever has said it does not think the law is viable, but if passed before the unification is finalised, it would be a reason to stop it.Britains departure from the European Union gives some extra urgency, as a delay beyond this year could mean additional scrutiny from EU and British regulators."}
