{"text": "MADRID, Aug 12 Spains top league soccer clubs on Thursday approved private equity firm CVCs proposed investment in return for long-term access to a share of LaLigas revenues, provided that individual clubs can opt out of the deal, two sources said.In an attempt to win enough support for the 2.7 billion euro plan, CVC had modified its original proposal shortly before the vote, allowing clubs in LaLiga, which covers Spains top two soccer divisions, to take part on a voluntary basis.Despite the approval by 38 clubs out of LaLigas 42, the deal still faces legal risks after drawing fierce opposition from top clubs Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.
