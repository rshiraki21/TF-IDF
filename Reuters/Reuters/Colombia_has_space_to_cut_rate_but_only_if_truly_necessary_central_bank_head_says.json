{"text": "BOGOTA, April 12 Colombia has space to further lower its benchmark interest rate if truly necessary, the head of the central bank board said on Monday, though room for a more expansive monetary policy is limited amid international financial conditions and less investor risk appetite on emerging markets.Colombias bank board has held the rate at a historic low of 1.75% since cutting 250 basis points from borrowing costs last year as it sought to help economic growth during the coronavirus pandemic.I cant affirm weve reached a lower limit where it would be impossible to cut rates more, board chief Leonardo Villar said during a virtual panel discussion with other Ibero-American central bankers. That space effectively exists but its a space we could only use if we were sure it was indispensable and that its use would not be a detriment to credibility.Monetary policy depends a great deal on inflation, Villar said, and Colombias rate is already strongly expansive.Colombias consumer prices grew 1.5% in the 12 months to March, reaching half of the banks long-term target rate of 3%.The low borrowing costs are meant to help Latin Americas fourth-largest economy recover from the coronavirus, returning to pre-pandemic growth levels by the middle or end of 2022. The bank expects 5.2% growth this year, after an economic contraction of 6.8% in 2020.Our economies are still more vulnerable to external shocks and, in particular, abrupt changes in exchange terms and international financial conditions, Villar said.In current conditions where international medium and long-term interest rates have shown an important upward adjustment, the risk that portfolio investors have a reduced risk appetite for emerging markets is not insignificant, which obviously reduces the available space for more expansive monetary policies on the part of our central banks, Villar added."}
