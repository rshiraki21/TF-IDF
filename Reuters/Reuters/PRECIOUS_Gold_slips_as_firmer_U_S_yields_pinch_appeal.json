U.S. gold futures        settled down 0.7%\nat $1,732.70.\n    Elevated yields are still an underlying negative for the\nmetals markets that produce no dividend or yield, said Kitco\nMetals senior analyst Jim Wyckoff. \"The bulls lost a little bit\nof momentum and that is prompting shorter term technical traders\nto press the sell side, putting prices under pressure.\"\n    U.S. Treasury yields remained slightly higher following a\ngood three-year note auction, and ahead of key data releases\nthis week, including consumer price inflation on Tuesday.\n           \n    Retail sales data is expected on Thursday.             \n    Higher yields threaten gold's appeal as an inflation hedge\nas they increase the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which\npays no interest. \n    Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in comments aired on\nSunday, said the U.S. economy was at an \"inflection point,\" with\nhopes of more growth and hiring in the coming months. He also\ncited risks of a spike in COVID-19 cases if there is a hasty\nreopening.             \n    A new Fed framework builds in allowances for inflation to\nrun above the central bank's 2% target for a time without the\nFed intervening to rein it in. \n    Gold is likely to benefit if inflation rises much higher\nthan the target, said StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell. \"If we do\nstart seeing inflation accelerating and people start thinking\ninterest rates are going to go up again, then gold might\nstruggle a bit.\"\n    Russia's Nornickel expects full output to resume at flooded\nmine             \n    Among other precious metals, silver        fell 1.7% to\n$24.82 per ounce.\n    Palladium        gained 1.3% to $2,674.68 per ounce and\nplatinum        dipped 2.3% to $1,170.90, having earlier hit a\nnear two-week low of $1,164.50.\n    The world's largest palladium producer, Russia's Nornickel\n          said it will fully restart operations this month at\none of two major mines hit by flooding, earlier than previously\nexpected.              \n\n (Reporting by Shreyansi Singh, Sumita Layek and Eileen Soreng\nin Bengaluru; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Richard Chang)\n  "}
