{"text": "    * Indian shares, rupee gain ahead of inflation data\n    * Philippine c.bank seen holding key rate - Reuters poll\n    * Thai baht bearish bets highest in six years - Reuters poll\n\n    By Sameer Manekar\n    Aug 12 Most emerging markets in Asia rose on\nThursday, with India and Indonesia leading the gains, as a tame\nU.S. inflation reading temporarily eased fears that the Federal\nReserve would begin policy normalisation, while regional\ncurrencies were mixed.\n    India's Nifty 50 added 0.4% to climb for a fourth\nstraight day, and the rupee appreciated about 0.3%\nahead of monthly retail inflation data due later in the day.\n\n    A Reuters poll showed the country's retail inflation in July\nslowed to a three-month low, bringing it back within the central\nbank's target range and likely becoming the lowest inflation\nprint since May.\n    \"The Reserve Bank of India is likely to continue with\naccommodative stance even if there is an uptick in CPI\nprojection for this fiscal,\" Arnob Biswas, FX research head at\nSMC Global Securities said.\n    With steady foreign inflows into India and a likely lower\nCPI reading will push the rupee higher, Biswas said, adding that\nthe currency may dip below 73.70 by August-end as the Fed's\ntapering narrative cannot be ruled out.\n    In the Philippines, equities declined as much as 1.8%\n as the country grapples with rising cases of the Delta\ncoronavirus variant, while Indonesian shares added 0.8%.\n\n    Currencies in the region were mixed despite a slight\nmoderation in U.S. inflation for July knocking the U.S. dollar\noff its four-month highs and temporarily easing concerns of a\nfaster normalisation timeline by the Fed.\n    \"It stands to reason that U.S. Treasury yields and U.S.\ndollar being contained after a recent pick-up is not to be\nmistaken for a sustained capitulation; certainly not on account\nof one CPI data point,\" said Venkateswaran Lavanya, an analyst\nat Mizuho Bank.\n    South Korea's won weakened 0.3% to hit its lowest\nsince October as the country battled to contain its worst\ncoronavirus outbreak, while Singapore dollar slipped\n0.15%. \n    The Philippine peso showed some resilience in the\nface of surging virus cases, adding 0.2% ahead of a central bank\npolicy meeting where it is expected to hold its key interest\nrate at record-low of 2%, a Reuters poll showed.\n    Analysts at Dutch bank ING expect the Bangko Sentral ng\nPilipinas to hold the key rate steady, but added that \"a\npossible reduction in the reserve requirement is now likely to\nhelp shore up liquidity support\".\n    Meanwhile, a Reuters poll showed investors remained bearish\ntowards most Asian currencies, with the Thai baht \nfaring the worst as economies across the region continued to\nstruggle with Delta variant outbreaks, while strength in the\ndollar also weighed.\n    Markets in Thailand were closed for a public holiday.\n    \n    HIGHLIGHTS:    \n    ** Indonesian 10-year benchmark yields tick lower to 6.341%\n    ** Taiwan dollar appreciates 0.2%\n    ** Thai c.bank eyes credit market to help kick-start economy\n\n    \n  Asia stock indexes and                            \n currencies at   0650 GMT                      \n COUNTRY  FX RIC        FX    FX  INDE  STOCK  STOCK\n                     DAILY   YTD     X      S  S YTD\n                         %     %        DAILY      %\n                                            %  \n Japan               +0.00  -6.4  <.N2  -0.20  2.08\n                               9  25>          \n China    <CNY=CFX   +0.03  +0.7  <.SS  -0.16   1.55\n          S>                   9  EC>          \n India               +0.20  -1.6  <.NS   0.36  16.88\n                               4  EI>          \n Indones             -0.03  -2.4  <.JK   0.66   2.50\n ia                            0  SE>          \n Malaysi             +0.14  -5.0  <.KL  -0.09  -7.63\n a                             1  SE>          \n Philipp             +0.02  -4.7  <.PS  -1.65  -8.17\n ines                          6  I>           \n S.Korea  <KRW=KFT   -0.41  -6.4  <.KS  -0.38  11.66\n          C>                   6  11>          \n Singapo             -0.15  -2.7  <.ST   0.25  12.10\n re                            0  I>           \n Taiwan              +0.16  +2.4  <.TW  -0.04  16.88\n                               5  II>          \n \n    \n\n    \n (Reporting by Sameer Manekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Simon\nCameron-Moore and Uttaresh.V)\n  "}
