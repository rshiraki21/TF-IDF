It followed Augusts 0.6% year-on-year decrease.Wholesale prices also slid 0.2% in September from August, marking the first on-month drop in four months, the data released by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) showed.With the global economy still reeling from the pandemics pain, the pace of its recovery remains modest.

Analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second wave of infections weigh on consumption.(This story corrects month-on-month figure to -0.2% from -0.1% in 2nd bullet and paragraph 4)"}
