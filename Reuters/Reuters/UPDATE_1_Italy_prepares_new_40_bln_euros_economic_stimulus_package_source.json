{"text": "(Adds details and background)ROME, April 12 Italys government is preparing a new stimulus package worth around 40 billion euros ($47.60 billion) to support its coronavirus-battered economy, a source close to the matter said on Monday.The extra borrowing will probably push this years budget deficit above 10% of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 9.5% in 2020 when the economy shrank by 8.9% as a result of the coronavirus curbs, a government source told Reuters last week.The money will fund additional grants to businesses forced to close due to coronavirus restrictions and extend an existing debt moratorium for small and medium-sized companies, hard hit by the restrictions aimed at curbing the infections.Romes last official estimate, made by the previous government in January, envisages a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 8.8% this year. That was premised on an economic growth forecast of 6%, which officials say will have to be revised down to a figure between 4% and 5%.The new stimulus will also increase Italys huge public debt, equal to 155.6% at the end of 2020 and proportionally the second highest in the euro zone after Greece.The last time Italy registered a double-digit deficit was in the early 1990s.The new deficit and debt targets, along with multi-year GDP growth forecasts, will be issued in the Treasurys Economic and Financial Document, which is expected to be approved this week.
