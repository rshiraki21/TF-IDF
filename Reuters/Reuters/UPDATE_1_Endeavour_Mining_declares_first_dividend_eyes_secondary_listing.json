The planned listing plan, initially unveiled in August, is targeted for the second quarter of next year.De Montessus also said he would consider a share buyback if and only if the share price continues to underperform.Endeavour also extended the mine life and production outlook of its two core mines, Ity in Ivory Coast and Hound in Burkina Faso, in updated plans.Hound is expected to produce an extra 106,000 ounces of gold per year on average over the next five years, up 27% from Endeavours previous projection. Ity is seen producing an additional 170,000 ounces over the next 10 years, up 58% from the previous mine plan.Endeavour on Tuesday said it was in talks to combine with smaller miner Teranga Gold.
