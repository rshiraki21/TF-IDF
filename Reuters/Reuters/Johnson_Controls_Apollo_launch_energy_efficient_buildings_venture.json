{"text": "NEW YORK, Aug 12 Johnson Controls International and Apollo Global Management are forming a joint venture which will provide services to businesses to help improve the energy efficiency of their buildings, the companies told Reuters.The venture, focused on North America and utilizing Johnson Controls technology and the capital of the private equity firm, will allow companies to make enhancements to structures without paying significant sums upfront.Instead, the venture will make changes, such as installing renewable power generation and battery storage or a more efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and then charge a monthly fee.Reducing energy consumption by buildings is seen as a major step to achieving sustainability goals and averting major climate change. Residential and commercial buildings in the United States make up around 40% of the countrys total energy consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration.Building modifications can be expensive though, a prohibitive consideration for companies which are already contending with economic uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic.The joint venture falls into the emerging energy-as-a-service sector, which aims to address this cost issue. The savings made, such as from lower electricity costs, can cover much of the monthly payment, Geoff Strong, Apollos Co-Head of Infrastructure and Natural Resources, told Reuters.Strong declined to comment on how much money Apollo was putting up. He said the venture would target large corporates, while there was potential for some of the private equity firms portfolio companies to also be customers.
