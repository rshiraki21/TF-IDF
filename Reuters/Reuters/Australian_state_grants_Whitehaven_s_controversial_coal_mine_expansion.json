{"text": "A New South Wales state regulator on Wednesday gave the green light for Australian miner Whitehaven Coal Ltd to proceed with the expansion of a controversial coal mine, in a blow to local farming communities.Whitehaven applied in 2018 to expand the Vickery project, asking for approval to increase coal extraction by nearly 25%, increase the peak annual extraction rate more than three-fold and also expand the so-called disturbance area.The states Independent Planning Commission (IPC) said it had received 1,928 unique submissions regarding the application  with 40% in support, 57% against and 2% neutral  as well as 935 campaign emails objecting to the application.However, the IPC said it found that the impacts associated with the expansion were acceptable and in the public interest, when weighed against an increased disturbance footprint and additional environmental impacts.Whitehaven welcomed the decision, saying the A$700 million ($498 million) expansion would generate jobs for 500 people during construction and 450 ongoing roles thereafter.The Lock the Gate Alliance community action group described the outcome as bitterly disappointing and an indictment of the New South Wales state governments failure to protect farmland, communities, and water resources.Following this approval, if the company decides to proceed with the new 10 million tonnes per annum coal mine, it will irreparably alter the social fabric of the Boggabri farming community and hurt agriculture in the district, it said in a statement.The IPCs decision comes ahead of its ruling due in September on a coal seam gas project at nearby Narrabri proposed by Santos Ltd.The project has also drawn strong opposition from farmers and environmental groups due to concerns about potential damage to water supply and a state forest."}
