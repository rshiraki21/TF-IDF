{"text": "The plans by Best, which went public in New York in 2017 and has a market value of $1.8 billion, are preliminary and the offering size and target valuation have yet to be determined, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information was private.The Hangzhou-based company, which has been unhappy with its New York valuation, decided not to include smaller units such as its supply chain management business in the Hong Kong listing as seeking a valuation for just the two delivery units would be more straightforward, one of the sources saidThe two units brought in nearly $4 billion in revenue last year, around 80% of the companys overall revenue.The move also comes amid escalating geo-political tensions between the United States and China and tightening scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese firms. Those uncertainties have prompted a number of Chinese companies to seek a second listing in Hong Kong.Best and the banks declined to comment.The e-commerce giant, which in June increased its stake in Best to 33% via a $150 million convertible bond, also declined to comment.Alibabas interest in the float would mark another effort to gain more say in the worlds biggest logistics market which is rapidly growing but remains highly fragmented.Best, which had 11.9% share of the Chinese express delivery market last year, is one of several couriers that work with Alibabas logistics division Cainiao.Best, led by founder and CEO Johnny Chou, a former Google executive, posted a 20.5% drop in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier and a net loss of 751 million yuan ($108 million), hit hard by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic."}
