{"text": "As long as the case counts are high, I think that we have to expect that travel will be relatively modest, Kelly said at a Texas Tribune event. Were continuing to see traffic and revenues down 75% versus a year ago today and to think that would recover to the point we would be profitable I just think is unrealistic.The company last month posted a $915 million loss for the second quarter. Kelly said it is still burning through about $20 million a day.Were still losing cash every single day, he said. Weve got a long way to go before we can feel like we are out of intensive care.Southwests has cut its scheduled flights by about 35% to 40%, Kelly added. The airlines are less full, Kelly said, noting the airline was not booking middle seats.Nearly 17,000 Southwest employees have agreed to voluntary long-term leaves or exit packages.The solution here is to get our passengers back -- not to try to shrink the airline so radically that were prepared for a very, very modest travel environment, Kelly said.Southwest shares Wednesday closed largely unchanged.S&Ps forecast for 2020 global passenger traffic has worsened to a drop of between 60% and 70% from between 50% and 55% estimated in May."}
