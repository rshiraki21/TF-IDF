{"text": "NEW YORK Crude prices rose more than 2% on Wednesday after government data showed U.S. oil inventories fell across the board, bolstering hopes that fuel demand in the worlds biggest economy will withstand the coronavirus pandemic.U.S. crude oil, gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week as refiners ramped up production and demand improved, a government report showed.U.S. fuel demand rose to 19.37 million barrels per day last week, the highest since March, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.Were seeing the demand bounce back, said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group. The market is tightening a lot quicker than people thought.The most surprising statistic was the decline in oil production by 300,000 barrels per day at the same time that weve been hearing producers talking about restoring production, said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Thats going to give more support to crude oil prices for the balance of the year.The EIAs downward revision on Tuesday to a key U.S. oil production forecast for this year also lent support to prices.U.S. crude production is forecast to fall 990,000 bpd this year to 11.26 million bpd, steeper than the 600,000 bpd decline it forecast last month.World oil demand will fall by 9.06 million bpd this year, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a monthly report on Wednesday, more than the 8.95 million bpd decline expected a month ago.Still, growing uncertainty over a stalemate in Washington in talks for a stimulus package to support recovery from the deepest impact of the pandemic may weigh on prices.In India, refined fuels consumption fell to 15.68 million tonnes in July, down 11.7% year-on-year and 3.5% below Junes levels, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas showed."}
