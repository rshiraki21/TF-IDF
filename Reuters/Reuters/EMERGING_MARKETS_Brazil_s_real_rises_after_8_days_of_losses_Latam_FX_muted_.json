{"text": "    * Real down nearly 7% over past 8 sessions\n    * Chilean economic growth seen surging\n    * Oil weighs down Mexican, Colombian FX\n\n    By Ambar Warrick\n    July 12 Brazil's real rose slightly on Monday,\ntaking some support from expectations of an economic recovery\nthis year, while most other Latin American currencies moved\nlittle as a surge in global cases of the Delta COVID-19 variant\nprompted caution. \n     The real rose 0.2% after tumbling nearly 7% over the\npast eight sessions, in the wake of serious graft allegations\nrelated to vaccine procurement against the government. \n    A recent poll showed a majority of Brazilians support\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro's impeachment, amid growing discontent\nover his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and allegations of\ncorruption.\n    The real is expected to benefit from a strong economic\nrecovery in Brazil this year. But a laggard job market and\nspiking inflation could hurt its prospects, even with the\ncentral bank hiking lending rates sharply. \n    \"We expect the ongoing recovery to strengthen into the\nsecond half of the year as the vaccination rollout continues to\nadvance. This will benefit the sectors hit hardest by the\npandemic  especially the services sector,\" analysts at TS\nLombard wrote in a note.\n    \"Still, we believe that the job market is likely to lag the\noverall recovery.\" \n    Rising iron ore prices, on expectations of more liquidity in\nChina, also helped the real on Monday.\n    \n    Broader Latin American currencies were largely unchanged,\nwith MSCI's index rising 0.2%.\n    Chile's peso rose 0.6% as a central bank survey of\nanalysts showed the economy will expand by 16.5% in June and by\n11.9% in the third quarter this year.\n    But despite the expectations of a strong rebound, concerns\nover the drafting of the country's new constitution have held\nback Chilean assets in recent months.\n    The government also raised its inflation forecast for 2021,\nwhich has been a common theme in markets as more economies\nreopen with a bang from COVID restrictions.\n    Mexico's peso and Colombia's peso fell\nslightly, tracking declines in oil prices as markets feared a\nhit to demand from the Delta variant.\n    Latin American stocks rose in early trade, but kept to a\ntight range established over the past few sessions, as investors\nawaited more solid cues on global economic growth. \n    In Cuba,  thousands of civilians joined street protests from\nHavana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government\ndemonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades.\n\n    Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called for an\nend to the U.S.-Cuba economic embargo to help its people, in\nlight of the protests.\n    Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies:\n    \n                              Latest       Daily % change\n MSCI Emerging Markets         1324.75                    0.5\n                                        \n MSCI LatAm                    2531.39                   0.78\n                                        \n Brazil Bovespa              126582.52                   0.92\n                                        \n Mexico IPC                   49525.02                  -0.49\n                                        \n Chile IPSA                    4270.24                   0.53\n                                        \n Argentina MerVal                 0.00                      0\n                                        \n Colombia COLCAP               1292.44                  -0.04 Currencies             Latest       Daily % change\n Brazil real                    5.2486                   0.18\n                                        \n Mexico peso                   19.8976                  -0.24\n                                        \n Chile peso                     744.08                   0.58\n                                        \n Colombia peso                 3829.79                  -0.07\n Peru sol                       3.9639                  -0.13\n                                        \n Argentina peso                96.0900                  -0.10\n (interbank)                            \n                                        \n \n    \n\n    \n (Reporting by Ambar Warrick; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n  "}
