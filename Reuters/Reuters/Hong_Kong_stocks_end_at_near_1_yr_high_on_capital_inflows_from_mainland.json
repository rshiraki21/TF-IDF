The Hang Seng China Enterprises index rose 1.43% to 11,217.69.** The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares rose 1.2%, while the IT sector rose 0.08%, the financial sector ended 2.31% higher and the property sector rose 0.33%.** Analysts said gains were supported by rising capital flows from mainland.
