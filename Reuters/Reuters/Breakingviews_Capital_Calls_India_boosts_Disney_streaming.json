{"text": "NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Concise insights on global finance in the Covid-19 era.-------------------------------------------------PLUS OR MINUS. Walt Disney said on Thursday that subscriptions to its direct-to-consumer flagship streaming service hit some 95 million for the quarter ending Jan. 2. The $346 billion entertainment giant launched Disney+ in November 2019 and it has seen hyper growth thanks partly to its ownership of Indias Hotstar, the service that airs Indian Premier League cricket and was formerly part of Fox.Disney+ Hotstar, launched last April, now accounts for 30% of its global subscribers. But this growth comes at a cost. Average revenue per user in the quarter fell 28% year-on-year to $4.03. Strip out Disney+ Hotstar, and ARPU was $5.56. By comparison Netflix, with over 200 million customers, pulls in above $7 per subscriber. Investors, though, may be willing to tolerate Disneys Indian equation. After all, the companys market value has increased more than 60% since April 2019 when it laid out detailed plans for its streaming strategy, handily beating the S&P 500 Index. (By Jennifer Saba)"}
