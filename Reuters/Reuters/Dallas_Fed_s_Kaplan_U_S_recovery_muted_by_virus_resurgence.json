{"text": "Aug 12 The U.S. recovery has been muted by the resurgence of the coronavirus in recent weeks and could mar improvement in the unemployment rate, Dallas Federal Reserve president Robert Kaplan said on Wednesday.The rebounding continues but with the resurgence that has muted the rebound, it has muted the recovery, Kaplan said in Webcast remarks to the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce. He said he thought the unemployment rate could fall to 9% by the end of the year, or even below that, but it requires adherence to protocols particularly wearing masks...If we dont follow that, while people may feel freer, the economy will grow slower.
