The metal's prices had slumped to a nine-month low on\nMonday, but a pullback in Treasury yields helped spark a rebound\nthat has put gold on track for a weekly gain of 0.4%.\n    U.S. gold futures        fell 0.8% to $1,709.10.\n    \"It's basically a function of elevated yields and although\nyields aren't marching higher, the problem is they're not going\nlower, and that presents a problem,\" said Stephen Innes, chief\nglobal market strategist at financial services firm Axi. \n    \"Gold's going to hold around $1,700 ... unless we break new\nground on higher yields.\"\n    Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields             climbed,\nincreasing the opportunity cost of holding gold, while the\ndollar        bounced back from a near one-week low.      \n    Investors are now awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting\nnext week for direction on its monetary policy.\n    President Joe Biden on Thursday signed his $1.9 trillion\nstimulus bill into law and said he was working to speed COVID-19\nvaccinations and move the country closer to normality by July\n4.            \n    \"The implementation of Biden's pandemic relief bills is\nstoking fears of a massive supply of bonds hitting the market,\nas well as rising inflation,\" ANZ analysts said in a note.\n    \"The continued rollout of vaccines is also supporting the\nlabour market, thus diminishing support for safe-haven assets.\"\n    Silver        eased 1.4% to $25.70 an ounce, but was on\ntrack for its best week since mid-February with a 1.7% rise.\nPalladium        fell 0.9% to $2,324.10. \n    Platinum        shed 0.8% to $1,185.85, but was set to post\nits best week in four with a 4.8% gain.\n\n (Reporting by Sumita Layek in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi\nAich, Aditya Soni and Uttaresh.V)\n  "}
