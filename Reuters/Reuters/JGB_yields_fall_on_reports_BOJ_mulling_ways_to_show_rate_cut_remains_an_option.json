{"text": "TOKYO, Feb 12 Japanese government bond yields fell on Friday, after media reports that the Bank of Japan is mulling ways to signal its ability to cut interest rates at its policy meeting next month.While no final decisions have been made, BOJ officials see a need to make it clearer that reducing rates further below zero is an option while considering ways to minimize the side effect of such a move, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. (bloom.bg/3jE4RFC)Such a move, which Jiji News Wire also reported about, is meant to dispel market scepticism that the BOJ has little further room to cut rates below the current target of minus 0.10%.The 10-year JGB yield fell one basis point to 0.065%, while the 20-year JGB yield dipped 0.5 basis point to 0.460%.The 30-year JGB yield was unchanged at 0.665%.The benchmark 10-year JGB futures rose 0.17 point to 151.66, with trading volumes of 18,131 lots.
