Softer iron ore futures due to the present coronavirus situation spurred declines in top miners BHP Group and Rio Tinto.Local tech stocks ended at a month-low, tracking an overnight rout in U.S.-based peers after tech giants took steps to limit outgoing U.S. President Donald Trumps social media reach.On the flip side, financials gained 0.7%, with the so-called Big Four banks adding between 0.8% and 1.1%.New Zealands benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index eased 0.8% to finish the session at 13,183.69.The country heightened virus screening for inbound international travellers, requiring visitors to show negative COVID-19 test results before boarding flights to the island nation.
