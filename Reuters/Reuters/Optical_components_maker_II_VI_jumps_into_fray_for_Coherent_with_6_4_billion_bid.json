{"text": "Optical components maker II-VI Inc has offered to buy laser maker Coherent for about $6.4 billion, entering a bidding war for a larger share of a market tipped to benefit from rising adoption of 5G networks and consumer electronics.Coherent agreed to a $5.7 billion deal with optical fiber specialist and Apple Inc supplier Lumentum Holdings last month, and weeks later received a $6 billion rival offer from MKS Instruments.The company has said its largest unit, microelectronics, was poised to get a lift from demand for flat panel displays and organic light emitting diodes such as the ones in Apples latest iPhones.Coherents just beginning a cyclical upturn, said Mark Miller of Benchmark, adding that the market estimates the companys earnings to go up considerably over the next eighteen months.II-VI on Friday made a cash-and-stock offer that valued Coherent at $260 per share, a premium of 14.6% to the stocks last close.The offer, II-VI said, represented a premium of 24% to the implied value of the Coherent-Lumentum deal and a 9.8% premium to MKS offer.Shares of Coherent jumped 14%, while II-VIs stock slipped 5%. Lumentum and MKS rose 2% and 3%, respectively.Coherent said it was reviewing II-VIs offer while its board continued to back the Lumentum deal.Lumentum and II-VI have been involved in the sectors consolidation. In 2018, Lumentum bought optical components maker Oclaro for $1.8 billion, while II-VI purchased Apple-supplier Finisar for about $3.2 billion.II-VI on Friday also said its offer was more likely to pass muster with regulators.Since II-VI has substantially less product overlap with Coherent than either Lumentum or MKS, II-VI believes there is greater certainty of closing, the company said."}
