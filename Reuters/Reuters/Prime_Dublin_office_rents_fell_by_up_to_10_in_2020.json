{"text": "DUBLIN, Feb 12 Rents for prime city centre office space in Dublin fell by up to 10% year on year in 2020, according to two surveys, as disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic halved the number of new lettings compared to 2019.Rents fell below 60 euros ($73) per square foot for the first time since 2016, property agent HWBC said on Friday, a drop of around 10%. A separate survey from property consultancy Knight Frank put the annual fall at around 8%.HWBC said the take-up of new space fell to its lowest level since 2012 - when Ireland was midway through an EU/IMF bailout - as firms postponed long-term letting decisions.The reduced demand also led to a rise in the vacancy rate and an increase of grey space coming to the market, HWBC said, referring to companies looking to sub-let excess space that is surplus to requirements.However, it expects the declining market to be short-lived, pointing to multinational companies, including Amazon, Dropbox, Mastercard and Slack, accounting for seven of the ten biggest deals in 2020, despite the increase in remote working.Investors and potential occupiers face a narrow window of opportunity to strike before the appetite to acquire and lease space returns with a vengeance in the second half of the year, HWBC Managing Director Tony Waters said, linking the return in occupiers confidence to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines."}
