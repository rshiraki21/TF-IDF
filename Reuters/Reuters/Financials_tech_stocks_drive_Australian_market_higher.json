{"text": "Australian shares settled higher on Tuesday for the seventh straight session, as financials jumped on some economic optimism and dividend hopes, and technology stocks tracked Wall Street higher.There are some signs that there is a bit of optimism for the economy moving forward, and thats helping banks have a pretty good run, said James Tao, a market analyst at CommSec.Last week, the Australian government pledged billions in tax cuts and measures to boost jobs, which was quite accommodative for the economy.Additionally, eased lending standards for banks have also brightened growth prospects for the economy, which slid into recession for the first time in nearly 30 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Banks are still tempting for punters who believe dividends will come back, said Brad Smoling, managing director at Smoling Stockbroking."}
