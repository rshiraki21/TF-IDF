{"text": "LONDON, Nov 12 Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday that news of a possible effective vaccine for COVID-19 was encouraging and would help lift uncertainty holding back the economy, but there was still a way to go in trials.Its obviously encouraging us. I mean its encouraging for individuals, its encouraging for businesses and its encouraging for the economy, Bailey said during a Financial Times event.I think we have to be cautious because obviously theres still quite a way to go in terms of the trialling.He also said data published earlier on Thursday showing Britains economic recovery slowed in September, before new coronavirus restrictions were ordered, underscored the huge gap that remains compared with the economys size before the pandemic."}
