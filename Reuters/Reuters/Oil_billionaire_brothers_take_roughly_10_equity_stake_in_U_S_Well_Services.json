It has the option to purchase seven additional licenses at $7.5 million each, and 10 more at $9 million each.We believe these investments not only demonstrate the value of our intellectual property, but also offer further evidence that our industry is rapidly transitioning towards next-generation fracturing technology, led by electric fleets, said a spokesperson for U.S. Well Services in a statement.Dan Wilks has been scooping up shares in oilfield services firms hard hit by the downturn in drilling and fracking with stakes in ProPetro Holding Corp and NexTier Oilfield Solutions.The Wilks brothers also have been engaged in a lengthy court battles seeking to take over Canadian pressure pumper Calfrac Well Services Ltd."}
