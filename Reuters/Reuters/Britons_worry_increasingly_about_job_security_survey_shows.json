Figures due for release at 0600 GMT on Wednesday are likely to show the country has fallen into a recession.The Bank of England last week forecast the jobless rate would hit 7.5% at the end of this year, almost double its most recent reading.The Kantar survey showed a sharp fall in the proportion of respondents who believed the government was lifting coronavirus restrictions too quickly and an increase in those who thought the pace was right or too slow."}
