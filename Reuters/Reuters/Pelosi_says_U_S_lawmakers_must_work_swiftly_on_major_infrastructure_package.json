{"text": "U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she has directed key Democratic lawmakers to begin working with Republicans on a major infrastructure package.Democrat Pelosi, who met on Thursday with the chairs of U.S. House of Representatives committees that will oversee the infrastructure package, said in a statement: \"Congress must work swiftly ... to craft a big, bold and transformational infrastructure package.\"A Pelosi aide told Reuters infrastructure is \"next in terms of top priorities.\"One big question mark remains how to pay for a massive boost in spending, which had prevented Congress from approving a big package for more than a decade.  Pelosi said she hoped the measures will address transportation as well as \"other critical needs in energy and broadband, education and housing, water systems and other priorities.\"As a candidate, President Joe Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion in fixing highways, bridges and airports; building climate-resilient homes; wiring cities for broadband internet; and encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations.House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio told Reuters on Wednesday his \"tentative timeline\" is to have his committee's portion of a major infrastructure bill approved by the panel in May. \"It is going to be green and it is going to be big, he said."}
