{"text": "SYDNEY, March 12 Yields on Australian three-year government bonds slipped to a record low on Friday as the countrys central bank pushed back against market speculation of early interest rate hikes though the local dollar jumped to a one-week high.Yields in the cash market had jumped to 0.188% late last month during a global bond sell-off. Three-year bond futures had then implied a yield of 0.385%, much higher than the Reserve Bank of Australias (RBA) 0.1% anchor.In response, the RBA this week doubled the fee it charges for lending out April 2023 and April 2024 Australian government bonds, both key to policy stimulus.That sent the three-year bond yield to under 0.096%, the lowest on record.If you see this from the RBAs yield curve control policy this move has definitely worked in the sense that its reinforced their target at 0.1%, said Robert Thompson, a rates strategist at RBC.But it hasnt necessarily stopped the market from speculating or anticipating rate hikes earlier than the RBA thinks they will happen.Thompson pointed to the two-year/one-year swap rate at 61 basis points, which suggested more than two rate hikes by 2023.On Friday, the three-year bond contract was down a shade, implying a yield of 0.228%. It had earlier jumped to 0.385%.Dovish commentary this week by RBA Governor Philip Lowe also helped stem some of the bond sell-off after he dismissed rate-hike talks, analysts said.That still did not stop the Aussie dollar from hitting a one-week high on Friday.The Aussie climbed to $0.7801, a level not seen since March 4. It was last at $0.7780 with key resistance seen around $0.7840, a breach of which could see it flying above 80 U.S. cents.The New Zealand dollar surpassed key resistance at $0.7200 to go as high as $0.7240, a level unseen since March 3. The kiwi has drifted away from the weeks trough at $0.7103, which now marks a strong support.For the week so far, the kiwi is up 0.7% while the Aussie has risen 1.3%.Stronger-than-expected domestic data and soaring prices of Australias top export iron ore have also boosted the Aussie.Figures on consumer and business confidence have been robust this week, in a sign the economic momentum apparent in the second half of 2020 has sustained into the New Year.Investor attention next week will be on a speech by RBAs Lowe on Monday, followed by the RBA minutes of its March 2 policy meeting on Tuesday.Australias labour force data is due on Thursday which is likely to show strong jobs growth and a fall in unemployment.
