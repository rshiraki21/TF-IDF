{"text": "HAMBURG, Oct 12 Ten more cases of African swine fever have been confirmed in wild boars in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, Germanys agriculture ministry said on Monday.The new discoveries bring the total number of confirmed cases to 65 since the first one on Sept. 10. All were in wild animals with no farm pigs affected, it said.Germanys Friedrich-Loeffler scientific institute had confirmed the latest animals had African swine fever, the ministry said. All were found in the area around the first discoveries.China and a number of other pork buyers banned imports of German pork in September after the first case was confirmed, causing Chinese pork prices to surge.The disease is not dangerous to humans but it is fatal to pigs and a massive outbreak in China, the worlds biggest pork producer, and elsewhere in Asia led to massive changes in global pork trade flows.
