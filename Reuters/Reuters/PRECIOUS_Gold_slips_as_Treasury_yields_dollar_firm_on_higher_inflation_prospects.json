{"text": "    * U.S. producer prices rise more than expected in March\n    * U.S. economy at an \"inflection point\", says Powell\n\n (Updates prices)\n    By Diptendu Lahiri\n    April 12 Gold prices fell on Monday, weighed\ndown by firmer U.S. Treasury yields and dollar after\nbetter-than-expected U.S. economic data lifted prospects for\nhigher inflation.\n    Spot gold        fell 0.2% to $1,739.20 per ounce by 0735\nGMT. U.S. gold futures        were down 0.2% to $1,740.50 per\nounce.\n    \"Stronger-than-expected data suggests that inflation (will\nbe) picking up faster than expected in months to come, which is\nleading to a rise in real yields, exerting pressure on gold,\"\nsaid Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX.\n    \"Asia Pacific markets were expected to open higher but they\nare trading lower this morning, raising demand for safe assets\nand the dollar is winning that race, putting further pressure on\ngold.\"            \n    Producer prices in the United States rose more than\nanticipated in March, resulting in the highest annual rise in\n9-1/2 years and signalling the start of higher inflation as the\neconomy reopens amid strengthened public health and substantial\ngovernment assistance.             \n    Some investors view gold as a hedge against higher\ninflation, but higher Treasury yields dull some of the appeal of\nthe non-yielding metal.      \n    The dollar index        rose 0.1% against rival currencies,\nmaking gold expensive for buyers outside the United States.\n      \n    \"For now, gold looks set to trade quietly in a $1,730 to\n$1,760 range, with Bitcoin seemingly the safe-haven asset of\nchoice at the moment,\" OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey\nHalley said in a note.             \n    \"In the meantime, gold remains at the mercy of the U.S.\n10-year Treasury yield.\"\n    Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy\nis at an \"inflection point,\" with hopes that inflation and\nhiring will accelerate in the coming months, but there are\ndangers if a hasty reopening leads to a continuing uptick in\ncoronavirus cases.             \n    Elsewhere, silver        fell 0.6% to $25.09 and palladium\n       was down 0.4% to $2,628.40. Platinum        slipped 1% to\n$1,186.06 \n\n (Reporting by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh\nKuber and Rashmi Aich)\n  "}
