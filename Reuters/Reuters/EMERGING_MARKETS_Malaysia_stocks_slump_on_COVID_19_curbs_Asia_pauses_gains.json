{"text": "    * Banks lead Malaysian declines after new lockdown \n    * Analysts expect economic harm from Malaysia's new lockdown\n    * Rupiah falls as U.S. 10-year yields top 1%\n\n    By Nikhil Nainan\n    Jan 12 Malaysia led losses across Southeast\nAsian stock markets on Tuesday after a state of emergency was\ndeclared in the country to curb the spread of COVID-19,\nthreatening its economic recovery and sending banking stocks\nsharply lower. \n    Malaysia's main stock index pared some of its 1.6%\ndecline by noon, while other Asian stock markets tracked\novernight losses on Wall Street. South Korean shares\nwere closed down 0.7%. The prospects for further U.S. fiscal\nstimulus had boosted several Asian markets on Monday.\n    Malaysia's King Al-Sultan Abdullah declared a nationwide\nstate of emergency on Tuesday to curb infections, a day after\nthe prime minister announced a 14-day lockdown in the capital\nand five states.\n    Alex Holmes, an emerging markets economist at Capital\nEconomics, said the lockdown will likely \"hit the economy hard,\"\nprompting the research firm to cut its 2021 growth forecast to\n7% from 10%. \n    Holmes also expects the central bank to cut rates next week\nfrom the current 1.75%. The ringgit weakened 0.2%.\n    Meanwhile, CGS-CIMB Securities reckons the restrictions\ncould be extended and estimates every fortnight of curbs will\nshave 0.7% off Malaysia's 2021 growth forecast.\n    Indonesia's rupiah dipped 0.5% against the dollar,\nwhich tracked U.S. Treasury yields higher. Ten-year U.S. yields\ntopped 1% last week for the first time since March last year. \n    The rupiah is generally favoured by foreign investors\nseeking to tap Indonesia's high-yielding debt. \n    TD Securities expects short-term pressure to continue on the\nrupiah as U.S. yields rise and inflows into local bond markets\ntemporarily ease. \n    The Taiwanese dollar, which tends to move in wider\nranges, strengthened 1.8%. Taiwan's central bank has sent\ninspectors to domestic banks to investigate whether exporters\nare speculating in foreign currency as the local currency has\nsoared in recent months, Reuters reported on Monday.\n\n    \n    HIGHLIGHTS:\n    ** Indonesian 3-year yields are up 7.7 basis points at\n5.071%, while 10-year benchmark yields are up 2.80 basis points\nat 6.246%\n    ** CIMB Group Holdings, RHB Bank Bhd and\nHong Leong Bank Bhd all slumped more than 3%\n        Asia stock indexes and currencies at 0656 GMT      \n COUNTRY      FX          FX       FX      INDEX    STOCKS   STOCKS\n              RIC         DAILY %  YTD %            DAILY %  YTD %\n Japan                    +0.08    -0.88            0.09     2.62\n China                    +0.29    +1.04            1.92     3.64\n India                    +0.09    -0.34            0.23     3.84\n Indonesia                -0.49    -0.78            -0.04    6.71\n Malaysia                 -0.20    -0.94            -0.91    -1.51\n Philippines              +0.18    -0.02            -0.64    1.66\n S.Korea                  -0.24    -1.25            -0.71    8.79\n Singapore                +0.14    -0.59            -0.08    4.84\n Taiwan                   +1.75    +1.74            -0.36    5.21\n Thailand                 -0.10    -0.63            -0.19    5.81\n \n (Reporting by Nikhil Kurian Nainan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ana\nNicolaci da Costa; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\n  "}
