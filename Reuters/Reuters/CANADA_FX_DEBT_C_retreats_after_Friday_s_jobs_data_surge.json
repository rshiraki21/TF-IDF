{"text": "    * Canadian dollar weakens 0.2% against the greenback\n    * Oil rises rise \n    * Canadian bond yields modestly higher across the curve\n\n    By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n    April 12 The Canadian dollar edged down against\nits U.S. counterpart on Monday, unwinding some of the gains\nlogged in the previous session, but buoyant oil prices helped\nkeep the currency near recent highs.\n    At 9:52 a.m. EST (1352 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading\n0.2% lower at 1.2553 to the greenback, or 79.66 U.S. cents.\n    The loonie had risen 0.3% on Friday after data showed Canada\nadded far more jobs than expected in March, bringing employment\nto within 1.5% of pre-pandemic levels.             \n    Investors' expectation for a continued rise in U.S. Treasury\nyields has been supportive of the greenback, helping keep the\nCanadian dollar from breaking above the three-year high of\n$1.2361 touched in mid-March.\n    \"Fridays stellar jobs data should not be far from\ninvestors minds and while we expect some of the jump in jobs to\nbe unwound this month as a result of Ontarios lockdown moves,\nthe trend in jobs and progress on access to vaccines should\nprovide policy makers with enough confidence in the outlook to\nat least signal a move towards tapering asset purchases at the\nApril 21st policy decision,\" Shaun Osborne, chief currency\nstrategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.\n    \"We look for the Canadian dollar to remain better supported\non dips and to make a bit more progress in the short run back\ntowards a $1.24 handle,\" Osborne said.\n    On Monday, a rise in the price of oil, one of Canada's main\nexports, helped the loonie fend off deeper losses against its\nU.S. counterpart.             \n    Canadian government bond yields were modestly higher across\nthe curve, with the 10-year trading at 1.518%, not far from its\nclose on Friday at 1.5%.\n\n (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n  "}
