{"text": "LONDON, April 12 Sri Lankas government bonds jumped to their highest level since September on Monday, on reports that the government had sealed a long-awaited $500 million loan deal with the China Development Bank.Sri Lankan bonds due to mature on July 22 climbed 2 cents to above 82 cents on the dollar having been as low as 65 cents early last month on worries that the islands deteriorating finances could lead to a default.The $500 million loan which will be disbursed this week, should provide a further boost to Sri Lankas FX reserves which the central bank recently estimated at $4.1bn in end March, excluding the $1.5bn PBOC FX swap line, analysts at JPMorgan said in a research note.China approved a 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) currency swap with Sri Lanka last month.Sri Lankas government bonds are now some of the best performers in the world this year. They have an average total return of 16.1% year-to-date versus -3.6% for the widely followed EMBI-Global Diversified emerging market index.JPMorgan added that the bonds were likely to find further near-term support given benign backdrop for EM sovereigns, although we think investors should sell into the strength.Dwindling foreign reserves, a tumbling currency and rising debt levels have dogged Sri Lanka over the last year, leading to increasing fears of a default.The government of Prime Minister Gotabaya Rajapaksa - which has drawn the country closer to China, to the frustration of neighbour India - has said this will not happen.($1 = 6.5443 Chinese yuan renminbi)"}
