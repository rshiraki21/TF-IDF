{"text": "International Business Machines Corp said on Monday its managed infrastructure services business would be called Kyndryl after a planned spinoff into a public company later this year.The plan to separate was announced in 2020, and followed years of the Big Blue trimming its legacy businesses as it focused on its cloud offerings to counter slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers.Arvind Krishna, who took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April last year, had earlier said IBMs software and solutions portfolio will account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.Kyndryl will be headquartered in New York, IBM said."}
