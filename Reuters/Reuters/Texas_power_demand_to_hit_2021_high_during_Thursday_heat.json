{"text": "Aug 12 The Texas power grid operator forecast demand would reach its highest in 2021 on Thursday as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to combat another heatwave.The grid had also forecast power use would reach that level on Aug. 9-11, only to pull back those outlooks as cooler weather reduced the peaks.Temperatures in Dallas were expected to reach the upper 90s Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) every day from Aug. 8-14, according to AccuWeather. That, however, is in line with the citys normal high of 97 degrees F at this time of year.The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates most of the states grid, projected power use would reach 73,200 megawatts (MW) on Aug. 12, 73,592 MW on Aug. 18 and 73,978 MW on Aug. 19.Those peaks, if they are met, would top this years current high of 72,856 MW on July 26, but would fall short of the grids all-time high of 74,820 MW in August 2019.One megawatt can power around 200 homes on a hot summer day.Extreme weather reminds Texans of the February freeze that left millions without power, water and heat for days during a deadly storm as ERCOT scrambled to prevent a grid collapse after an unusually large amount of generation was shut."}
