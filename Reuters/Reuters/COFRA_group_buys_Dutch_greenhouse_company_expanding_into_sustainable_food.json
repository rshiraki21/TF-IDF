{"text": "AMSTERDAM Privately-held COFRA, owner of clothing retailer C&A, is buying Dutch horticulture technology business Dalsem for an undisclosed sum, the Switzerland-based group said on Wednesday.The acquisition of Dalsem, a greenhouse systems company with more than 100 million euros ($114 million) in annual sales, fits into COFRAs strategy of investing in tackling the biggest social and environmental challenges facing the world, said COFRA CEO Boudewijn Beerkens.With 60,000 employees, COFRA began diversifying into clean energy and sustainable food in 2020 as part of a mission to be a force for good as well as a commercial interest in entering new, high-growth markets, Beerkens said.The group plans to make more mid-sized acquisitions in the sectors to supplement its existing operations in real estate, asset management, private equity and fashion.In the end we selected clean energy and sustainable food because we believe they are social issues that need positive impact and we want to play a role, he said.Dalsem, with 78 employees, is COFRAs third investment in renewable energy and food security since 2020.No financial details of the deals have been disclosed, but COFRA expects the food and energy businesses to make up roughly 20% of its total portfolio within a decade, Beerkens said.COFRA took a stake in Intelligent Growth Solutions (IGS), a Scotland-based agri-tech and vertical farming company, in 2021 and purchased Sunrock, the largest developer of solar roofs in the Netherlands, in 2020."}
