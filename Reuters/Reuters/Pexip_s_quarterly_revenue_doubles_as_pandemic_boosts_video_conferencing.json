On its initial public offering (IPO) in May, the companys shares rose more than 50% on their first day of trading.Pareto Securities, one of the brokers that worked on the IPO, said the second-quarter revenue was 14.8% ahead of its forecast while costs were 7% lower than expected.We reiterate our buy rating and a target price of NOK 105 per share, Pareto said in a note to clients.Taking advantage of its own technology, Pexip conducted an all-virtual roadshow in April and May to market its shares to investors, making it the first European company to complete an initial public offering remotely."}
