He's talking\nabout nationalisation, about the government taking control of\nthe economy... it's something that could bring significant\nvolatility to the market, just to the bonds overall,\" said\nAlejandro Arevalo, emerging market debt manager at Jupiter Asset\nManagement. \n    Other Latam currencies pared gains and tuned to losses with\nall eyes on U.S. consumer price inflation data, ahead of which\nthe dollar traded steady. \n    Brazil's real erased gains to trade almost 1% lower,\nwhile Mexico's peso traded flat. As oil prices pared some\ngains, crude exporter Colombia's peso extended losses to\na second day. \n    While most main stock indexes joined a rout in global stocks\nahead of U.S. inflation data and earnings, Brazil's Bovespa\nindex outperformed, up 0.6%, led by financials and\nmaterial stocks. \n    \n    Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1904 GMT:\n  Stock indexes           Latest   Daily %\n                                   change\n MSCI Emerging Markets    1320.65    -0.73\n                                   \n MSCI LatAm               2318.92    -0.77\n                                   \n Brazil Bovespa         118413.95     0.63\n                                   \n Mexico IPC              47290.33    -0.71\n                                   \n Chile IPSA               4944.90    -0.27\n                                   \n Argentina MerVal        48080.99   -1.566\n                                   \n Colombia COLCAP          1315.98    -0.46\n                                   \n                                          \n      Currencies          Latest   Daily %\n                                   change\n Brazil real               5.7293    -0.99\n                                   \n Mexico peso              20.1731    -0.13\n                                   \n Chile peso                 713.2    -0.22\n                                   \n Colombia peso            3663.51    -0.15\n                                   \n Peru sol                  3.6167     0.09\n                                   \n Argentina peso           92.5700    -0.14\n (interbank)                       \n                                   \n \n (Reporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru and Tom Arnold in\nLondon;\nEditing by Gareth Jones)\n  "}
