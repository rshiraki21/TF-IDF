{"text": "* Estimated funding needs widen after port blast* New government will have to prioritise reforms* Hezbollah sword of Damocles -economist* Reserves could shed further $6-7 billion* Financial recovery plan may be ditched -sourcesLONDON/BEIRUT, Aug 12 Lebanon may be in line for $298 million in emergency aid after the Beirut port blast, but the more than $30 billion some estimate it may need to rebuild its shattered economy will not be forthcoming without reform.Such change could be stalled by the resignation of Lebanons government, while a financial rescue plan drawn up in April is likely to have to be reviewed and possibly even ditched by a new administration, two financial sources close to the plan said.Forecasts for financial metrics such as debt to GDP and the parallel exchange rate contained in the rescue plan, which had already struggled for support before last weeks deadly explosion, now look unrealistic, one of the sources added.That is likely to push back creditor talks to restructure Lebanons international sovereign debt.Lebanon had begun International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout talks in May after defaulting on its foreign currency debt. But these were put on hold due to lack of progress on reforms and differences over the size of financial losses.While Prime Minister Diabs cabinet remains as a caretaker government after its resignation, Lebanons already diminishing foreign reserves are set to be eroded faster to pay for the rebuilding of Beiruts port and other infrastructure.So devising a credible economic plan will be the main test for whoever ends up running Lebanon, which faces tumbling net capital flows amid an intensifying scramble for hard currency.The best gauge of the governments sovereignty will be the economic plan they draft, Carlos Abadi, an adviser to the Association of Banks in Lebanon, told Reuters.In the wake of the blast, Lebanons external financing needs for the next four years had swelled to more than $30 billion from $24 billion, Garbis Iradian at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated.In order to overcome the U.S. veto at the IMF, the next government will have to produce a plan which is premised on the positioning of the economy for future growth, without the possibility of billions being diverted for nefarious purposes, Abadi said.The IMF reaffirmed its support for Lebanon on Sunday, before the governments resignation, but also the need for reforms, a point stressed by French President Emmanuel Macron last week.With the number of Lebanese living in poverty nearing half its population, these reforms range from setting up social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable to ensuring Lebanons wealthy elite share the burden of financial losses from bank recapitalisations.Macron also called for an audit of the banking system, a comment that has triggered wariness among some bankers fearful the government may use the data to spare family and friends.French MP Loc Kervran, chair of the France-Lebanon committee, told Reuters such an audit would aim to uncover unorthodox practices which could have led to losses.SWORD OF DAMOCLESForeign donors have made it clear that outside humanitarian aid, no money would be given to Lebanon without reforms.Some countries are particularly concerned about the influence of Iran through Hezbollah, a Shiite political group and guerrilla army designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States, which helped form Diabs government.Economist Toufic Gaspard said that as long as Hezbollah controlled the levers of power, economic recovery would be hampered as the group would not accept reforms such as border and customs controls.This is the sword of Damocles hanging above everybodys head ... if this situation is not addressed, I dont see how we can have a sustainable solution, said Gaspard, who has advised the IMF and the Lebanese finance ministry, added.Meanwhile, with limited external funding support, surging inflation and the parallel exchange rate plummeting to 9,290 pounds per U.S. dollar by 2021 under a worse case scenario, Lebanon will continue to sink, said the IIFs Iradian.Lebanons central bank has told local banks to extend zero-interest U.S. dollar loans to those impacted by the blast for repairs, which analysts say will come from official reserves.These could fall by $6 to $7 billion by the end of 2020 from around $18 billion, said Nafez Zouk at Oxford Economics.Lebanon would be running out of usable reserves.
