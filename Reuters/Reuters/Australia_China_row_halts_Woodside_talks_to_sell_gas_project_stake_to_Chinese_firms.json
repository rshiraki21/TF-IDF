{"text": "MELBOURNE Woodside Petroleum shelved talks to sell stakes in a gas field and liquefied natural gas (LNG) project to Chinese companies a few months ago because of a growing diplomatic row between Australia and China, the companys chief said on Thursday.Chief Executive Peter Coleman said he hopes to revive the talks when the spat subsides.They advised us a couple of months ago that they were just not able to proceed at this point due to the relations between China and Australia, Coleman said.So were a little frustrated and disappointed by that. But were hopeful that things will improve and well be able to get them back to the table, he told Reuters in an interview.Diplomatic relations with China, Australias top trading partner, have deteriorated after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus.The frayed ties have hit exports of Australian coal, barley, wine, timber and lobsters, but analysts have expected LNG would be immune as Australia is the biggest supplier of LNG to China.The restrictions, so far, do not appear to have affected Australian exports of LNG to China, research firm EnergyQuest said in a report on Thursday.EnergyQuest estimates China imported 23.5 million tonnes of Australian LNG in the first 10 months of this year, in line with the first 10 months of last year.Coleman said the diplomatic row had not hurt Woodsides existing partnerships with Chinese companies in Australia and Myanmar, where he said the relationship was very good.Woodside is also looking to sell down its recently enlarged stake in the Sangomar oil project in Senegal.No. The Australia-China thing is very specific to investments in Australia. Its not a general issue, Coleman said.The collapse in Woodsides talks with the Chinese was first reported by the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday."}
