{"text": "BERLIN, Aug 12 Freenet is being richly rewarded for its bet on Swiss telecom Sunrise after backing Liberty Globals $7.4 billion takeover, and will use most proceeds to pay down debt, CEO Christoph Vilanek said.The German telecoms investor has signed a binding agreement to tender its 24.2% stake at 110 Swiss francs after the Sunrise board backed Libertys cash offer. It paid 70 Swiss francs.Its a fair valuation, Vilanek told Reuters. We believe that a merger on sensible terms makes sense.He anticipated no antitrust obstacles after Switzerlands cartel authorities raised no objections to a proposed deal last year for Sunrise to buy Libertys Swiss cable unit UPC. Freenets opposition effectively scuppered that deal.Freenet will reap 1.1 billion euros ($1.29 billion) in proceeds from the sale, from which it will repay 800 million in debt as required under its loan covenants.As a result, its leverage ratio will fall to around 2 times, below its target level of 2.5. That is very healthy, Vilanek said. (Reporting by Douglas Busvine; editing by Thomas Seythal)"}
