But total tourism revenues were only 77% of pre-virus levels at 113.23 billion yuan ($17.6 billion), the government data showed.Sun said prospects for outbound travel looked bright once the pandemic is contained and more people globally are vaccinated. The most-searched European destinations on Trip.coms platforms include the UK, Switzerland, Italy and Greece, she said.The demand is there, she said. Peoples buying power is strong."}
