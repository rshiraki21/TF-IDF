{"text": "    SINGAPORE, April 12 Asian refining margins for 10 ppm gasoil edged higher on\nMonday, climbing to their highest in more than a month, riding on expectations for tighter\nsupplies in April due to spring maintenance at regional refineries.\n    Refining margins, also known as cracks, for 10 ppm gasoil rose to $6.92 per\nbarrel over Dubai crude during Asian trading hours, the highest since March 4. The cracks have\ngained 45% so far this month, and were at $6.46 a barrel on Friday.\n    Scheduled turnarounds at some refineries in China, Japan and South Korea, alongside\nunplanned fire-related shutdowns at Eneos Corp's Wakayama refinery in Japan and Pertamina's\nBalongan refinery in Indonesia late last month, would likely keep the gasoil market tight in the\nnear term, trade sources said.\n    But lack of arbitrage opportunities to the West amid lacklustre demand in Europe continues\nto weigh on the gasoil cracks, market watchers said, although some traders and refiners have\nbeen chartering new-build very large crude carriers (VLCCs) to take gasoil barrels to the West\non their maiden voyages.\n    A VLCC, Dickens, has loaded 65,000 tonnes of gasoil from Yeosu, South Korea and was anchored\nnear Singapore, where it is expected to load more cargo, according to ship-tracking data from\nKpler, and Refinitiv Oil Research.\n    The prompt-month time spread for 10 ppm gasoil in Singapore widened its\ncontango structure on Monday to trade at minus 19 cents per barrel.\n    \n    INDIA'S DIESEL DEMAND RISES IN MARCH\n    - India's fuel consumption rose in March, for the first time in three months, to its highest\nsince December 2019, as economic activity gradually picked up after a coronavirus-induced\nslowdown.\n    - Diesel consumption gained 10% in March from February to 7.22 million tonnes, and also rose\n27.6% year-on-year.\n    \n    TENDERS\n    - Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical Corp is looking to sell 750,000 barrels of 10 ppm gasoil\nfor May 19-23 loading from Mailiao. The tender closes on April 13 and has a same-day validity.\n    - Taiwan's CPC Corp has also offered 300,000 barrels of 10 ppm gasoil for May loading, a\nbroker source said.\n\n    SINGAPORE CASH DEALS\n    - No gasoil deals, no jet fuel trades\n        \n    OTHER NEWS\n    - Oil prices edged higher in rangebound trade on Monday on optimism about a rebound in the\nU.S. economy as vaccinations accelerate, but rising COVID-19 cases in other parts of the world\nkept a lid on prices.\n    \n    ASSESSMENTS\n MID-DISTILLATES                                                                        \n CASH ($/T)             ASIA CLOSE       Change   % Change   Prev Close  RIC\n Spot Gas Oil 0.5%                65.65      0.6       0.92       65.05  GO-SIN\n GO 0.5 Diff                      -1.64    -0.04       2.50        -1.6  GO-SIN-DIF\n Spot Gas Oil 0.25%               65.82      0.6       0.92       65.22  GO25-SIN\n GO 0.25 Diff                     -1.47    -0.04       2.80       -1.43  GO25-SIN-DIF\n Spot Gas Oil 0.05%               66.07      0.6       0.92       65.47  GO005-SIN\n GO 0.05 Diff                     -1.22    -0.04       3.39       -1.18  GO005-SIN-DIF\n Spot Gas Oil 0.001%              67.23     0.59       0.89       66.64  GO10-SIN\n GO 0.001 Diff                    -0.06    -0.05     500.00       -0.01  GO10-SIN-DIF\n Spot Jet/Kero                    64.46     0.87       1.37       63.59  JET-SIN\n Jet/Kero Diff                    -0.59     0.01      -1.67        -0.6  JET-SIN-DIF\n                                                                                        \n For a list of derivatives prices, including margins,                                   \n please double click the RICs below.                                     \n Brent M1                                                                               \n Gasoil M1                                                                              \n Gasoil M1/M2                                                                           \n Gasoil M2                                                                              \n Regrade M1                                                                             \n Regrade M2                                                                             \n Jet M1                                                                                 \n Jet M1/M2                                                                              \n Jet M2                                                                                 \n Gasoil 500ppm-Dubai                                                                    \n Cracks M1                                                               \n Gasoil 500ppm-Dubai                                                                    \n Cracks M2                                                               \n Jet Cracks M1                                                                          \n Jet Cracks M2                                                                          \n East-West M1                                                                           \n East-West M2                                                                           \n LGO M1                                                                                 \n LGO M1/M2                                                                              \n LGO M2                                                                                 \n Crack LGO-Brent M1                                                                     \n Crack LGO-Brent M2                                                                     \n \n (Reporting by Koustav Samanta;\nEditing by Vinay Dwivedi)\n  "}
