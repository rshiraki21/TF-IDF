{"text": "(New throughout, adds CVM investigating the matter)SAO PAULO, Aug 12 Brazilian securities watchdog CVM said on Thursday it was investigating comments by a top executive of Minerva SA on social media and in a newspaper that sent shares of the meatpacker on a wild ride this week.On Thursday, Minerva shares were down 11.5% near market close, at 8.79 reais, the second largest drop among stocks in benchmark index Bovespa.On Wednesday, they had jumped 14%, a day after Minerva CFO Edison Ticle spoke about a potential delisting or share buyback in a live webcast on Instagram led by Rafael Ferri, a shareholder in social trading app TC TradersClub.On Wednesday, newspaper Valor Economico reported that shareholders in Minerva were considering a delisting and quoted Ticle on the matter. Later, the CFO confirmed in a statement to Reuters the company was considering the issue.Clearly there is an opportunity in Minerva shares, as the market looks very superficially at the companys results. ... We are considering all potential alternatives but we have nothing concrete so far, Ticle said a statement to Reuters on Wednesday evening.But around 11 p.m. on Wednesday, the company sent a securities filing denying a delisting.In a statement to Reuters, the regulator said the participation of Ticle in an Instagram live is being investigated in a probe under the number 19957.006435/2021-20.On Thursday, after CVM announced the probe, Minerva sent a new securities filing saying Ticle had spoken on social media in a hypothetical manner and never referred to concrete transactions.In a note to clients, BTG analysts led by Thiago Duarte said for a company whose dividends have just now become a reality after years working to deleverage the balance sheet (...) using cash to re-lever it so significantly doesnt make much sense.
