Of that amount invested, 62% was in Germany.TenneT operates 23,500 km of high-voltage grids, making it one of the regions largest investors in the planned energy transition to low-carbon fuels.Much of its investment goes into integrating more intermittent wind, solar and biomass power in the regions grids, new cross-border lines and network upgrades.As well as building wind turbine connections off the German and Dutch coasts, it is also working in the British and Danish North Sea.TenneTs net interest-bearing debt position increased by 27% to 12 billion euros year on year at the end of December.TenneT is in talks with the German government, which is interested in buying a stake.
