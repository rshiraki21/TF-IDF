This year was good and we did well considering we saw the first ever female winner, a William Hill spokesman said.888 said the seven-figure pay-out on Minella Times was the biggest single selection pay-out on its new Sports platform, adding that Minella Times was the third most popular selection in the race.One lucky customer had a treble of Minella Times, Thyme Hill, and Happygolucky throughout the Aintree festival - turning 6.50 into over 1,000 at odds of 157/1, the company said.The expertise in online gambling and sports betting that the bookmakers have in Britain, which is amongst the first major countries to regulate the market, has attracted American suitors as the United States opens up to sports betting."}
