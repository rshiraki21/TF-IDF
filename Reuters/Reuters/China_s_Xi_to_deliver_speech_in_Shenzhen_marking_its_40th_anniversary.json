{"text": "SHENZHEN, China Chinese President Xi Jinping will deliver a speech in Shenzhen on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of the establishment of Chinas first special economic zone in the southern city 40 years ago, the Xinhua state news agency reported on Monday.The leader of neighbouring Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, later said she would postpone her annual policy address scheduled for Wednesday and travel to Shenzhen instead, though she said no meeting with Xi was scheduled.Lam said she would go to Beijing later this month and aimed to hold her policy address by the end of November.On Sunday, the central government announced measures to give Shenzhen greater control over land use, intended to encourage foreign investment in the technology sector, while reducing red tape in energy and telecoms.One of the testing grounds for reforms that spurred Chinas high-paced growth over the last four decades, the Chinese Communist Party touts Shenzhen as a gleaming symbol of Chinas emergence as a global economic power.Xinhua did not give any details of Xis speech but it is likely to touch on further integration of the Greater Bay Area, a region that includes Hong Kong, Macao and nine cities in Chinas Guangdong province, including Shenzhen."}
