The dozen comedies include Dont Look Up with an all-star cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Timothe Chalamet, Tyler Perry, Meryl Streep and others.All but four of the films will be available to Netflix customers in the more than 190 countries it serves. Ten of the movies are in languages other than English.
