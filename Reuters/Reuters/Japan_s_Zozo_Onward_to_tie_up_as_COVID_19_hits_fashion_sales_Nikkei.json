{"text": "Zozo, Japans biggest online fashion mall, will offer Onward body-size data on a million customers, the business daily reported, without citing sources.Zozo and Onward were not immediately available for comment outside business hours on Sunday.Apparel makers such as Onward are struggling with poor sales from pandemic-related store closures and weak consumer spending. Rival Renown Inc filed the bankruptcy protection in May.Onward, which sells clothes under brands such as Kumikyoku, depends heavily on sales at Japanese department stores, which mostly reopened by late May but are still grappling with a decline in customers amid lingering fears of infections.Zozo was also hit by the departure of many brands setting up their own e-commerce sites instead of depending on the companys infrastructure. Onward was one of the retailers that left the site in 2018.The Nikkei said Onward plans to start selling 28 types of business clothing, such as jackets and dresses, from August by using Zozos data, aiming to boost annual sales to 10 billion yen ($94 million) in five years.Zozo was founded by a billionaire Yusaku Maezawa whose plans for a lunar flyby as the first private passenger on Elon Musks SpaceX mission had helped spread Zozos name globally."}
