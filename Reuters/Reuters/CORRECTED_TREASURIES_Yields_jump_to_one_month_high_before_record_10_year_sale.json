{"text": " (Corrects day in first paragraph to Wednesday)\n    By Karen Brettell\n    NEW YORK, Aug 12 U.S. Treasury yields jumped to\none-month highs on Wednesday before the Treasury will sell a\nrecord amount of 10-year notes, and after data showed a\nlarger-than-expected increase in consumer prices in July.\n    The Treasury last week increased auction sizes across the\ncurve and said that it plans to continue to shift more of its\nfunding to longer-dated debt in coming quarters as it finances\nmeasures to offset the impact of the epidemic.\n    \"This whole week we're dealing with supply coming into the\nmarket,\" said Tom Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies\nin New York.\n    The Treasury will sell a record $38 billion in 10-year notes\non Wednesday and an additional $26 billion in 30-year bonds on\nThursday.\n    A record $48 billion sale of three-year notes on Tuesday\ndrew solid demand after yields rose heading into the auction,\nmaking the notes more attractive.\n    Yields also rose on Wednesday after the Labor Department\nsaid its consumer price index rose 0.6% last month after\nrebounding 0.6% in June. In the 12 months through July, the CPI\naccelerated 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in June.\n    Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising\n0.3% in July and gaining 0.8% year-on-year.\n    \"This is a pretty surprising report,\" Simons said. However,\n\"year-over-year, you still see pretty weak readings. You have to\nlook at the overall economy and how much slack there is,\" Simons\nadded.\n    Benchmark 10-year note yields jumped seven basis\npoints to 0.662% after earlier reaching 0.691%, the highest\nsince July 7. They are up from a low of 0.504% on Thursday.\n    The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes\n steepened two basis points to 51 basis points.\n    Treasuries have also weakened this week as risk appetite\nimproved. Stocks rose on Wednesday with the S&P 500 crawling\ntoward a record high.\n    \n    August 12 Wednesday 9:33AM New York / 1333 GMT\n                               Price                  \n US T BONDS SEP0               178-29/32    -0-7/32   \n 10YR TNotes SEP0              139-60/256   -0-4/256  \n                               Price        Current   Net\n                                            Yield %   Change\n                                                      (bps)\n Three-month bills             0.105        0.1065    -0.006\n Six-month bills               0.12         0.1217    -0.002\n Two-year note                 99-242/256   0.1529    -0.008\n Three-year note               99-212/256   0.1826    -0.006\n Five-year note                99-208/256   0.2881    -0.002\n Seven-year note               99-56/256    0.4892    0.002\n 10-year note                  99-164/256   0.6631    0.005\n 20-year bond                  99-236/256   1.1294    0.010\n 30-year bond                  97-104/256   1.3562    0.009\n                                                      \n   DOLLAR SWAP SPREADS                                \n                               Last (bps)   Net       \n                                            Change    \n                                            (bps)     \n U.S. 2-year dollar swap         8.00         0.25    \n spread                                               \n U.S. 3-year dollar swap         6.50         0.00    \n spread                                               \n U.S. 5-year dollar swap         5.00        -0.50    \n spread                                               \n U.S. 10-year dollar swap       -0.50        -0.50    \n spread                                               \n U.S. 30-year dollar swap      -40.00        -0.25    \n spread (Reporting by Karen Brettell; Editing by Will Dunham)\n  "}
