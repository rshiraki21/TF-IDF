The dollar/yen pair typically moves in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year\nadvancing to a one-month high.\n    Stronger-than-expected U.S. CPI numbers, meanwhile, briefly lifted the dollar against a basket of\ncurrencies.\n    Data showed the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.6% last month after rebounding 0.6% in June. \nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI jumped 0.6% last month. That was the largest\ngain since January 1991 and followed a 0.2% rise in June.\n    But the market's focus was on the U.S. stimulus package. Investors are watching for signs a political\nimpasse in Washington over a further rescue package for the pandemic-hit economy can be overcome. \n    U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that the White House and top Democrats in\nCongress may not be able to reach a deal on coronavirus aid, in the fifth day without talks on the\nstalemate blocking relief to tens of millions of Americans. nL1N2FE0ND\n    \"Over the longer-term, the fact that there is no stimulus package is a good thing for the dollar. If\nwe're going to print another $3.5 trillion, that's bad for the dollar,\" said Ronald Simpson, managing\ndirector, global currency analysis at Action Economics in Florida.\n    But he added that the fact there's a stalemate in negotiations is a negative for the dollar in the\nshort-term.\n    In mid-morning trading, the dollar index, which has held above a two-year low hit last Thursday, was\ndown 0.3% against a basket of currencies at 93.390, after shedding gains made in Asian trading.\n    \"If there is no movement in the negotiations soon, the Fed's concerns are quite likely to have an\nimpact on the dollar sooner or later,\" FX analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.\n    Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3% to 106.77 yen.\n    Improved U.S. debt yields have pressured the yen by luring investment from zero-yielding Japan.\n    The euro was up 0.5% at $1.1793.\n    Sterling was broadly flat, despite data showing the British economy had entered a deep\nrecession, as signs of a recovery in June provided some support for the currency.    \n    The New Zealand dollar was flat at US$0.6576, after the country's central bank held rates but\nsurprised markets by extending its bond-buying programme and putting slightly more emphasis on the\npossibility of negative rates.\n    \n    ========================================================\n    Currency bid prices at 9:53AM (1353 GMT)\n Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid\n                                              Previous                   Change                 \n                                              Session                                           \n Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1790        $1.1739     +0.43%         +5.17%      +1.1799     +1.1712\n Dollar/Yen       JPY=        106.7200       106.4800    +0.23%         -1.97%      +107.0100   +106.4500\n Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     125.84         125.00      +0.67%         +3.19%      +126.0500   +124.9600\n Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9113         0.9167      -0.59%         -5.84%      +0.9198     +0.9110\n Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.3040         1.3048      -0.06%         -1.65%      +1.3067     +1.3006\n Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.3267         1.3300      -0.25%         +2.16%      +1.3346     +1.3258\n Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7154         0.7142      +0.17%         +1.89%      +0.7164     +0.7110\n ar                                                                                             \n Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.0746         1.0762      -0.15%         -0.98%      +1.0786     +1.0746\n Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.9040         0.8996      +0.49%         +6.93%      +0.9049     +0.8989\n NZ               NZD=        0.6573         0.6576      -0.05%         -2.42%      +0.6582     +0.6528\n Dollar/Dollar                                                                                  \n Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.9401         9.0138      -0.82%         +1.84%      +9.0499     +8.9310\n Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     10.5430        10.5760     -0.31%         +7.17%      +10.6038    +10.5378\n Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.6974         8.7505      -0.34%         -6.95%      +8.7903     +8.6859\n Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     10.2565        10.2913     -0.34%         -2.03%      +10.2995    +10.2440\n \n (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Iain Withers in London; Editing by\nBernadette Baum)\n  "}
