{"text": "LONDON The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Thursday it had secured just under 1.2 million pounds ($1.6 million) from a Brazilian national implicated in Brazils Operation Car Wash, the countrys biggest bribery investigation that began in 2014.The SFO said it opened a civil recovery investigation into Julio Faerman in 2015 after the former agent for Netherlands-based oil and gas services group SBM Offshore admitted paying bribes to win contracts from Brazils state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras).The body said it suspected Faerman had partly bought a 4.25 million apartment in west London with corrupt funds.Faerman is subject to a co-operation agreement with Brazilian prosecutors after paying a $54 million settlement, according to a London High Court judgment handed down in July.A London lawyer representing Faerman declined to comment.This is an excellent result for the SFO, sending a clear message that we will not sit back and allow the United Kingdom to be a safe harbour for dirty money, said Liz Baker, head of the SFOs proceeds of crime and international assistance division.Faerman has also been ordered to pay SFO costs of 57,000 pounds.($1 = 0.7597 pounds)"}
