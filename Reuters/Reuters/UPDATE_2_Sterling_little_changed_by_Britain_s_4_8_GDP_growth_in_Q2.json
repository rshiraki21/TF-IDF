{"text": "* Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh* Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv (Updates thoroughout)LONDON, Aug 12 Sterling edged lower on Thursday as analysts expected the Bank of England to make no imminent moves in its monetary policy after official data showed Britains economy grew in line with expectations in the second quarter.The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by 4.8% in the second quarter, in line with a Reuters poll of economists quarter-on-quarter expectations.After the data was released, sterling was little changed and slipped 0.2% versus the dollar at $1.3835 by 1526 GMT after rising in the previous session, interrupting a 3-day losing streak versus the greenback.Versus the euro, the pound traded just off 18-month highs touched on Tuesday and was 0.2% lower on the day, changing hands at 84.83 pence.ING analysts said it was unlikely that the GDP data would move the needle on the BoE story.Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital in London, said that for sterling, while the economic landscape continues to provide solid support, it does suggest further topside progress will be slow.It is quite likely that the pace of growth has already peaked, he added.In recent weeks, sterling has outperformed as COVID-19 cases have fallen and high vaccination rates allowed the British government to lift most social-distancing rules.GBP investors will be looking for direction in forthcoming UK data releases to gauge whether there is risk that the BoE could extend the hawkish element, seen last week, further in the months ahead, said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.Analysts said the BoE tone was slightly hawkish last week, when its monetary policy committee voted 7-1 to maintain the pace of its government bond-buying. But they said that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the BoEs three-year forecast period was likely to be necessary."}
