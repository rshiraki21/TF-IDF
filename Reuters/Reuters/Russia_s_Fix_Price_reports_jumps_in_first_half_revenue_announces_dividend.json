{"text": "MOSCOW, Aug 12 Russian low-cost retailer Fix Price on Thursday said its revenue rose 28.1% to 106.1 billion roubles ($1.44 billion) in the first half of 2021.The results lifted Fix Prices share price, which has lost around 20% since a market debut in March, to a more than three-week high.Fix Price raised around $2 billion in an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, the biggest Russian IPO since western sanctions were introduced in 2014, capitalising on the COVID-19 pandemic reducing Russians spending power and shopping more at low-cost retailers.The companys depositary receipts in Moscow were up 0.8% as of 0737 GMT, outperforming the wider index and after reaching their highest level since July 19 in early trade.Fix Price, which sells low-priced goods in walk-in shops and online, said double-digit like-for-like sales growth and adding 418 stores to its network in the first half of the year were behind the jump in revenue. Like-for-like sales grew 11.9%.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 24.1% to 19.8 billion roubles, with an EBITDA margin of 18.7%, down from 19.3% for the same period a year ago.Chief Executive Dmitry Kirsanov said in a statement this was a robust EBITDA margin, slightly below the unusually high level of last year and significantly above the same period in pre-COVID 2019.Fix Price said the company intends to pay an interim dividend of 11.5 roubles per share or global depositary receipt, amounting to 100% of profit under the international financial reporting standards for the first half of 2021.BCS Global Markets analysts said this payout implied a dividend yield of 2%.
