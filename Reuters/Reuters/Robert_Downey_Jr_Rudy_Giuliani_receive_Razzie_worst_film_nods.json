It will compete with Netflixs Polish erotic drama 365 Days, which also received six Razzie nods.Others contending for worst film included Music directed by musician Sia about a young girl with autism, and a movie remake of TV show Fantasy Island.Mike Lindell, chief executive of widely advertised company MyPillow and a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, was nominated for Absolute Proof, a film featuring baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. It also is competing for worst picture.Giuliani made the Razzies list for his brief appearance in Sacha Baron Cohens mockumentary Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.
