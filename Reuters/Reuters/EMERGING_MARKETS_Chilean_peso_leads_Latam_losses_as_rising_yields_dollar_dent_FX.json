{"text": "    * Chilean peso snaps three-day winning streak \n    * Argentina's basement bonds no bargain as IMF talks drag\n    * Mexico to evaluate need for tax reform after midterm\nelections\n\n (Adds bullets, updates prices throughout)\n    By Susan Mathew and Shreyashi Sanyal\n    March 12 A surging dollar and rising bond yields\ndented emerging market currencies on Friday, with Chile's peso\nleading declines after copper prices weakened, while developing\nmarket stocks also lost ground.\n    Bolstered by a strong rise in U.S. producer prices, a fresh\nspike in U.S. Treasury yields sparked a risk-off move, with the\ndollar reversing its fall from earlier in the week.\n    An index of EM currencies fell up to 0.2%,\ntipping it into the red for the week. Commodity-rich Latin\nAmerica's currencies were hit further by a slide in oil, copper\nand iron ore prices.\n    Brazil's real lost 0.4%, while top copper producer\nChile's peso slipped 1.3% after three straight days of\ngains. Colombia's currency gave up 0.6%, and gained the\nleast among regional peers on the week - up about 1.8% compared\nwith a 2% rise for an index of Latam currencies.\n    A pull-back in U.S. bond yields on easing inflation fears\nhad given a fillip to EM assets earlier in the week.\n    Brazil's real was set for its biggest weekly rise in two\nmonths, supported by central bank intervention and rising\nexpectations of an interest rate hike next week. After\nintervening throughout the week, the central bank said it will\nsell up to $750 million of FX swaps on Friday.  \n    Mexico's peso fell as much as 1.6%.\n    Finance Minister Arturo Herrera told Reuters that Mexico's\ngovernment will study the need for a tax reform this year and is\ntalking to regional authorities about their fiscal requirements\nto see if it is warranted.\n    A Mexican federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary\nfreeze to a new electricity-market law championed by the\ngovernment that strengthens national power company CFE at the\nexpense of private sector producers.\n    \"These legal setbacks will only intensify (President Andres\nManuel Lopez Obrador's) desire to change the constitution to\nshield his energy-sector vision from further legal setbacks down\nthe road,\" said Citi Research strategists. \n    Political interference in economic policy is one of\nsignificant risks cited by analysts broadly for investor\nsentiment to turn sour against Latam assets. \n    In Argentina, bonds have hit lows in recent weeks, but\nanalysts and investors say they are still no bargain, given\nstalled talks with the IMF, fears about a pre-mid-term election\nspending binge and dry weather denting crops.\n    Emerging market stocks lost 0.8%, with losses among\nLatam bourses led by Brazil's Bovespa losing 0.9%. \n    \n    \n    Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1815 GMT:\n    \n           Stock indexes                    Latest    Daily %\n                                                       change\n MSCI Emerging Markets                       1346.81     -0.79\n MSCI LatAm                                  2303.13     -0.86\n Brazil Bovespa                            113929.13     -0.92\n Mexico IPC                                 47631.10     -0.09\n Chile IPSA                                  4865.18     -0.33\n Argentina MerVal                           48876.25     1.066\n Colombia COLCAP                             1351.96      0.12\n                                                              \n              Currencies                    Latest    Daily %\n                                                       change\n Brazil real                                  5.5621     -0.39\n Mexico peso                                 20.7749     -0.85\n Chile peso                                    722.2     -1.27\n Colombia peso                                3573.4     -0.56\n Peru sol                                     3.7047     -0.32\n Argentina peso (interbank)                  90.8500     -0.07\n                                                      \n Argentina peso (parallel)                       139      0.72\n                                                      \n \n \n\n (Reporting by Susan Mathew and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru;\nEditing by Alexander Smith, Kirsten Donovan)\n  "}
