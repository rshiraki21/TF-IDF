It gained ground\nagainst the other G10 currencies.\n    One major cause of inflation has been higher prices for some\nof the commodities that Canada produces, including oil.\n    U.S. crude oil futures        settled 1.2% higher at $66.08\na barrel on signs of a speedy economic recovery and upbeat\nforecasts for energy demand.             \n    Canadian government bond yields were higher across the\ncurve, tracking the move in U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year\n            touched its highest since April 29, up as much as\n6.6 basis points on the day.\n\n (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Peter\nCooney)\n  "}
