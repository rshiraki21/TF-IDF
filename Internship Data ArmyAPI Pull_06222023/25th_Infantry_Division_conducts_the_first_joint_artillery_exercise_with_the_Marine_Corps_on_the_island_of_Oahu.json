{"text": "SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawaii -- Soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment (FAR), 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, and Marines of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing conducted the first joint artillery exercise at Makua Valley, Hawaii August 11, 2020.\n\nTwo Marine Corps V-22 Ospreys transported Tropic Lightning Soldiers and equipment from Schofield Barracks, Hawaii to Makua Valley, followed by two Army CH-47 Chinooks carrying M119A3 howitzers.\n\nThis was the first time Ospreys were used to transport Tropic Lightning Soldiers for a joint artillery exercise.\n\nGetting in and planning the event from start to finish and understanding how they operate versus how we operate was pretty challenging at first, said Lt. Col. John Gwinn, 3-7 FAR Battalion Commander. We couldnt ask for a better partner to execute it with us.\n\nWhen not in the air, Soldiers also conducted high frequency communications, tactical casualty combat operations and sling load procedures.\n\nDue to COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions there are new challenges presented with every\n\nmission in the new operating environment. Military leaders top priority is the health of the force but are also responsible for the readiness of their unit.\n\nIt&#39;s something that we can all persevere and push through to continue the mission. said Spc. Owen Davis, a gunner with 3-7 FAR.\n\nThe training exercise fostered relations with the Marine Corps and showcased the commands capability and lethality, even in the face of a global pandemic.\n\nWe continue to build upon this relationship with the Marines, Gwinn said. At the end of the day its a joint coalition force that is going to fight the nations wars.\n\n"}
