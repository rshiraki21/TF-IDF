{"text": "QUANTICO, Va. (Aug. 3, 2020)  Housing rental scams are on the rise worldwide. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, commonly known as CID, reminds the Army community to be cautious when responding to any advertisement regarding home or apartment rentals.\n\nAccording to Edward Labarge, director of CIDs Major Cybercrime Unit, scammers use a variety of tactics to steal peoples money before the victim determines the listing is fake.\n\nA typical rental scam works by a property being listed at a low price, usually below market rate, to get the attention of potential renters, said Labarge. Then the scammers will pressure the renters to pay a deposit and the first and last months rent to secure the rental.\n\nArmy CID reports there are currently millions of fake listings for apartments, duplexes, and houses listed on classified ads and reputable rental sites worldwide. The scam is accomplished when rentals are advertised, but they do not actually exist, are no longer available, or are up for sale.\n\nRental scams will be more prevalent in larger metro areas where there are a large number of real estate rentals on the market, said Labarge. This makes it easy for these types of scams to go unnoticed due to the large volume of rentals.\n\nAlthough rental scams may be targeted toward anyone seeking a rental property, military members may be more prone to falling victim due to frequent Permanent Change of Station moves.\n\nLabarge also said areas surrounding military installations are targeted due to competitive rental markets and service members having unique housing situations where they may not be available to view a property in person prior to arriving in the area.\n\nFake listings often lure victims in by offering military discounts, low rent, good neighborhoods, and great amenities.\n\nIf a house or apartment is being listed well below market norms, there is a reason, said Labarge. If its too good to be true, it usually is. Also, a good telltale sign that the listing is a scam is that the landlords wont want to meet you in person or there is no screening process. Every landlord will want to make sure they meet you in person, no matter how brief since they are making a major decision to trust that youll follow the rules of the lease.\n\nCID officials remind the Army community, if you feel you are a victim of a rental scam, contact your local CID office or law enforcement agency as well as the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nKnown types of rental scams:\n\nHijacked Ads.\n\nScammers use real rental ads and photos from legitimate postings to create their own fake ads. Scammers will often use the same name as the legitimate posting and change the email address, or other contact information, to their own.\n\nPhantom Rentals.\n\nScammers make fake listings using photos from properties that are not for rent, for sale, or do not exist.\n\nWatch for Warning Signs:\n\nThey want you to sign or send money before you see the property.\n\nThey want the security deposit or first months rent before you sign the lease.\n\nThey ask you to wire or send money through a payment app.\n\nThey say they are out of town or out of the country.\n\nThey are ready to make a deal with no background information.\n\nProtect yourself from becoming a victim of a rental scam:\n\nDo not rely solely on email to contact the owner and be wary of foreign telephone numbers.\n\nDo online research of the rental company, property address, and the owner.\n\nConduct a reverse image search of the photos to see where else the images are being used.\n\nAsk for additional photos. The actual owner or property manager should be able to provide additional photos.\n\nCompare rent amount to other rentals in the area.\n\nTake a tour, or have someone you know in the area tour for you, in person or by video.\n\nCall the company to verify before signing a lease agreement.\n\nNever pay a security deposit, first months rent, or application fee with cash, wire transfers, gift cards, prepaid cards, or payment apps because once you send it, there is no way to get your money back.\n\nObtain and review a copy of any contract prior to sending any money or providing any personal information.\n\nDo not make rush decisions. Scammers will often pressure suspecting victims to complete the deal quickly due to increased interest in the property, creating a false sense of urgency.\n\nIn addition, the Criminal Investigation Commands Major Cybercrime Unit continues to warn the Army community of ongoing Coronavirus-themed phishing attacks impersonating organizations with the end goal of stealing information and delivering malware.\n\nLabarge said the Major Cybercrime Unit continues to aggressively pursue cybercriminals both domestic and abroad who target our Soldier&#39;s and their families in their online campaigns.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nEditors Note: For more information about computer security, other computer-related scams, and to review previous cybercrime alert notices and cyber-crime prevention flyers visit the Army CID MCU website HERE.
