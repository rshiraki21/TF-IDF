{"text": "By Randall Jackson, U.S. Army Garrison Italy\n\nVICENZA, Italy  The Army Maintenance Activity, a new mobile-friendly website to submit work orders, is now live for U.S. Army Garrison Italy.\n\nArMA digitizes work orders for all Army-owned facilities. Its a centralized system for online submission and tracking, said Doug Enfield, ArMA program manager, who recently visited Caserma Ederle to discuss the software. The system lets Soldiers, family members, civilians and contractors  who reside or work on post  to submit online work orders for any Army facility. In the garrison, that includes roughly 1,900 buildings.\n\nAutomation of the maintenance-customer relationship is at the core of what we are doing, Enfield said. Customers expect this. This is part of the Army operating in the information age  not just for housing but for all facilities on the installation, which is what we call fence-to-fence.\n\nArMA officials estimate this will save more than 5,000 hours of manpower in one year. The program enables employees to spend more time addressing customers needs.\n\n&#34;We hope that customers give us a good description. When people submit a photo, the work gets done about 25 percent faster on average,&#34; Enfield said.\n\nAny registered user who notices a maintenance issue on their Army installation will be able to report the problem with ease. Additionally, unit leaders can create reports on maintenance status of all their buildings.\n\nIn Vicenza and Livorno, ArMA is the preferred method for community members to submit maintenance requests, said Steven Jaeger, from the garrisons Directorate of Public Works, Business Operations and Integration Division.\n\nDon&#39;t wait until you have a maintenance request to submit, Jaeger said. Register now. When you need to submit a maintenance request, you are already set up.\n\nTo use ArMA, visit www.armymaintenance.com\n\n"}
